00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.770
<v Wes>All right, let's get up and running with</v>

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.210
uploading some images.

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.090
In my Node course

4
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.430
I showed you how you can use something

5
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.450
called a Multer with Express in order to

6
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.710
actually upload the images to your own server.

7
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.620
So I thought I'd show you something

8
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.930
a little bit different in this course

9
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.040
and that is uploading to a external service.

10
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.450
This is called Cloudinary

11
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.230
and there's lots of other services out there.

12
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.780
I know Amazon allows you to upload images to them.

13
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.538
You could just use something like Imgur.

14
00:00:25.538 --> 00:00:27.150
I really liked Cloudinary

15
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.840
just because I've used it myself,

16
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.050
this is not sponsored or anything,

17
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.740
but when I put out a tweet poll,

18
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.010
it was overwhelmingly that people wanted to see

19
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.780
how to use Cloudinary to host their images.

20
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.050
Cloudinary is awesome because you can upload images,

21
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.560
it will do transformations which includes everything,

22
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.980
like a image compression, resizing images,

23
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.040
cropping, applying filters, all kinds of stuff like that.

24
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.402
You get the point,

25
00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:53.235
anything that's related to images,

26
00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:54.800
you'll be able to do it on Cloudinary.

27
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.570
They give you 10 Gigs for free

28
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.350
and then you can also refer a friend and get an extra what,

29
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.912
two Gigs worth of bandwidth, which is pretty wicked.

30
00:01:03.912 --> 00:01:06.760
So the free plan is pretty generous.

31
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.940
I've been pretty happy with it.

32
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.680
So here I've got a brand new account.

33
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.730
I just signed up for it,

34
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.540
like I haven't even verified my email just yet.

35
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.800
Maybe I'll have to do that before we upload one.

36
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.950
I've signed up for it and I just wanted to

37
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.030
make a couple settings changes that is going

38
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.040
to allow us to upload from the client without

39
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.670
having to have a server in the middle.

40
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.090
So click on settings here

41
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.054
and we're gonna click on upload.

42
00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:31.850
Now there's all kinds of different settings in here.

43
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.683
You can play with them,

44
00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:34.230
but we, what we really want to do is create

45
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.160
what's called a preset

46
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.820
and a preset set of settings that will apply

47
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.000
to any of our uploads.

48
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.940
So we'll click on add, upload presets.

49
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.803
We're gonna name this preset called sick fits.

50
00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:48.800
It's gonna be unsigned which is what we've had.

51
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.410
Folder that it's gonna go into is

52
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.500
gonna be called sick fits.

53
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.560
You can apply tags and all kinds of stuff

54
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.320
that you could possibly want.

55
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.517
However the thing that we do care about is down here.

56
00:01:58.517 --> 00:01:59.810
And we want to edit some

57
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.500
incoming transformations which is right here.

58
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.330
We're gonna set the width to be a thousand.

59
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.690
The mode is gonna be stuck on scale.

60
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.794
The format is gonna be auto and you can

61
00:02:11.794 --> 00:02:15.410
see some of the, some cheesy corner radius rotation.

62
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.680
Look and feel.

63
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.513
You can, I don't know,

64
00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:19.430
you can add a CPF filter like at the digital

65
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.130
camera from 12 years ago.

66
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.380
That's all we want.

67
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.260
And then you click on, okay,

68
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.700
that's gonna add those things here.

69
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.899
And then we're gonna add an eager transformation

70
00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:31.496
which is gonna sort of in the background

71
00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:34.630
transfer it to be a little bit bigger.

72
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.300
So we're gonna add an eager transformation.

73
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.650
Actually, sorry, real quick.

74
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.300
That shouldn't be not be a thousand.

75
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.970
The first one is gonna be 500.

76
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.530
And then in the background it's going

77
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.920
to do a larger transformation that might

78
00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:48.518
take a little bit longer.

79
00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:49.351
So, we're gonna.

80
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:50.518
Oops, I got to here, delete one.

81
00:02:50.518 --> 00:02:52.380
We're gonna edit this one.

82
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.198
It's gonna be a thousand pixels,

83
00:02:54.198 --> 00:02:58.440
so twice the size and the,

84
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.123
it's gonna be auto as well.

85
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.813
Good.

86
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.790
We are at the bottom and click on save

87
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.270
and we are up and running.

88
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.510
Now let's jump back to our component here.

89
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.790
We are gonna put a method on our create item

90
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.090
component that is gonna handle all of

91
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.480
the uploading of our images.

92
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.460
Gonna do that right below the handle change

93
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.270
and we're gonna call it upload file that I was

94
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.580
gonna take in the event.

95
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.423
And let's just console dot log uploading file.

96
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.930
Now what we want to do is whenever somebody selects

97
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.670
a file from an input box,

98
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.250
we're gonna actually trigger this upload file to do it.

99
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.120
So we'll go up in here and right above

100
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.190
everything else and I'm actually just going

101
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.113
to take one of the labels for title and pasted above.

102
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.907
We're gonna change that to file.

103
00:03:51.907 --> 00:03:56.907
And change this to say image,

104
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.613
so input type equals file.

105
00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:01.995
This file name is file, placeholder

106
00:04:01.995 --> 00:04:05.430
is upload an image.

107
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.740
It is the value is going

108
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.800
to be this, that state dot image.

109
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.810
And then when somebody changes this input,

110
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.760
we're gonna call that upload file method.

111
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.193
So this stuck up load file.

112
00:04:21.454 --> 00:04:24.540
Now let's go to our application here.

113
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.790
Go to sell and I get it.

114
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.700
But in an error failed to set the value

115
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.140
of property input, accepts a file name,

116
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.110
which may be both because there is no value

117
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.011
or move that and whoa, double what happened.

118
00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:41.480
That was weird.

119
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.900
That was probably the fact that they went

120
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.530
from error back to where we had it.

121
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.363
Good.

122
00:04:45.363 --> 00:04:46.196
So we've got this image.

123
00:04:46.196 --> 00:04:48.050
Let's go ahead and choose a file.

124
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.040
I've got a whole bunch of kind of cool things.

125
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.400
Ooh, nice cooler.

126
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.130
Upload it and let's see what's in our thing says

127
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.963
uploading files.

128
00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:57.351
So we.

129
00:04:57.351 --> 00:04:58.651
Every time we change this,

130
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.360
it's gonna trigger that upload file.

131
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.533
Good.

132
00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:04.800
And then we're gonna actually do

133
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.210
the heavy lifting inside of this.

134
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.043
First thing we're gonna do

135
00:05:08.043 --> 00:05:10.050
is pull the files out of that selection.

136
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.470
So say const files as equal to

137
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.230
either target dot files fails.

138
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.350
That is a fail files.

139
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.770
There we go.

140
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.287
Then we're gonna use the form data API,

141
00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:23.750
which is part of Java script in order

142
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.840
to sort of prep all of the data.

143
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.568
So say const data equals new form data

144
00:05:28.568 --> 00:05:33.290
and we'll take the data and append the file

145
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.530
and that is gonna be the first item

146
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.360
that the user selected.

147
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.050
Then we are also gonna add the upload preset.

148
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.040
This is a little piece of data that needs to come along.

149
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.310
So it append upload preset.

150
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.190
And this is just an argument that is needed by Cloudinary

151
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.150
and it's going to be called sick fits.

152
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.151
So if you named your preset something different

153
00:05:53.151 --> 00:05:57.660
than sick fits, which is what you've done here,

154
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.920
and make sure that you type that in there,

155
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.611
otherwise it's not gonna work.

156
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.190
Now we need to actually hit the Cloudinary API.

157
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.520
So say constant responses equal to await.

158
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.380
Oh, are awaiting.

159
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.813
So we're gonna make this an async function.

160
00:06:09.813 --> 00:06:12.971
And we're gonna use the third API to hit the API,

161
00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:17.971
so it's https, bomb bomb, api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/.

162
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.190
And then this is gonna be your actual end point

163
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.490
and if you don't know what your end point is, you can

164
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.450
see it right here on your upload page.

165
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.620
It will say the name of that you signed up with.

166
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.980
Mine is West Boss tutorial.

167
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.291
So forest West Boss tutorial for slash image

168
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:38.540
or slash upload, good.

169
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.930
Then factual tick.

170
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.888
Another number of arguments as a second argument here,

171
00:06:42.888 --> 00:06:46.280
they say method is post because by default

172
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.040
fetch does get and the body is gonna be the data.

173
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.050
That's this.

174
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.020
It's just the actual file itself.

175
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.870
And then in another argument called upload preset,

176
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.943
that gets put along.

177
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.120
Then we want to do is it's gonna upload that

178
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.140
and we want to parse the data that comes back.

179
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.973
So say cons.

180
00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:07.600
The file is equal to await response that JSON

181
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.933
Jews Sawn, JSON.

182
00:07:09.933 --> 00:07:13.050
Here we go, and that's just gonna convert the response

183
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.863
that we get into JSON.

184
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.710
And then we, let's just console,

185
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.210
log the file that we have there,

186
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.470
see what we've got,

187
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.833
but we can actually put the data that comes back into these

188
00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:25.980
two spots of our state.

189
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.240
Where did our state go here?

190
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.150
The image and the large image.

191
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.310
So let's do that.

192
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.930
This set state, the image is gonna be the file,

193
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.380
that secure URL, a large image is going

194
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.850
to be the file that eager first one dot secure year.

195
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.540
And again, the whoa,

196
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.630
again, the eager is a secondary transformed

197
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.210
that happens and it's gonna transform a larger version

198
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.090
of that and I just used that as the secondary

199
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.360
so we don't have to wait for both of them

200
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.729
to come back.

201
00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:56.932
That might make the requests a little bit faster.

202
00:07:56.932 --> 00:07:58.510
So let's take a look here.

203
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.569
Let's go back up here.

204
00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:04.180
A bit of an error, sink upload file.

205
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.073
Oh, that's because it's not a sink there.

206
00:08:06.073 --> 00:08:09.693
This is a sink.

207
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.993
Good.

208
00:08:11.993 --> 00:08:14.170
What I want you to do is open up your DEV tools,

209
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.006
go to your reactive tools and

210
00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:17.833
find your create item.

211
00:08:19.986 --> 00:08:22.510
And we're gonna watch the image

212
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.130
and the large image of our state.

213
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.840
So upload an image up up and Bam,

214
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.723
they came back.

215
00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:33.242
Let's take a look at our console.

216
00:08:33.242 --> 00:08:34.830
This is the data that comes back from Cloudinary.

217
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.860
It has all kinds of information about everything

218
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.693
that's going in.

219
00:08:38.693 --> 00:08:40.630
You can choose to save some more of this information

220
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.230
to your database if you need it.

221
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.585
I'm specifically just grabbing the secure URL

222
00:08:44.585 --> 00:08:48.130
and the security Arielle from the eager one

223
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.960
that was created.

224
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.350
And that is awesome.

225
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.350
Which should allow me now to submit this.

226
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.262
What was that?

227
00:08:55.262 --> 00:08:57.073
Camera sensor make to seventies.

228
00:08:58.426 --> 00:09:03.160
Big Price and love these.

229
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.390
Go ahead and submit it brings me to it.

230
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.563
I should be able to now go to my homepage,

231
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:11.590
scroll to the bottom.

232
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.230
And there they are.

233
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.680
Looks like they're showing up

234
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.530
but a stretchy problem.

235
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.370
So, we'll hit that in just a second.

236
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.387
Also, I'd like to it to show at the top of this.

237
00:09:23.387 --> 00:09:24.850
So we'll get into it.

238
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:29.340
But that item is now uploading it just fine.

239
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.427
So I'm happy about that.

240
00:09:30.427 --> 00:09:32.370
One little thing you might want to add,

241
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.070
I'm not gonna add it first simplicity sake,

242
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.770
but you might want to when you submit this thing, this form,

243
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.140
you might want to first check that the

244
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.590
images done uploading because there

245
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.350
could be a little bit of time where someone

246
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.650
uploads a file and then immediately hits enter,

247
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:51.360
then it's gonna send the data your API will still come back

248
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.720
with a specific error

249
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.107
saying, hey, you didn't provide to me a image

250
00:09:56.107 --> 00:09:57.640
or a large image but it's,

251
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.450
it might be a better experience to do that to the user.

252
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.684
So let's try it one more time and go to sell here.

253
00:10:02.684 --> 00:10:05.086
A blood annuity belt.

254
00:10:05.086 --> 00:10:08.170
One thing I would like to do is to display the image to

255
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.850
the user if there it is in there.

256
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.607
So let's go ahead and add that.

257
00:10:11.607 --> 00:10:14.160
Oh, go down right below this input.

258
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.780
Curly brackets will say this,

259
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.703
that state, that image and end, we'll do an image tag,

260
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.810
this, that state dot image,

261
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.120
and the Alt.

262
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.080
We'll set it to upload preview.

263
00:10:33.323 --> 00:10:35.163
Will that show us?

264
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.630
Beautiful.

265
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.890
Why are these images?

266
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.080
So funnily spaced,

267
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.670
oh, it looks like they're actually being sized like that.

268
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.700
So obviously a something wrong in my preset.

269
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.380
Let me go back and change my.

270
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.630
Oh, you see what I did is I set the height

271
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.240
and the width of this image.

272
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.797
So let's edit that preset right here

273
00:11:02.004 --> 00:11:03.903
and the height.

274
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.674
Delete it.

275
00:11:06.674 --> 00:11:09.710
That's just gonna auto scale itself.

276
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.080
That's why my images are being so funnily shown.

277
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.650
Another thing I can do here

278
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.980
is on this image tag,

279
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.660
you say width equals 200 and you see just a little

280
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.850
preview of your image that is showing up.

281
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.410
You can go ahead and submit it.

282
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.060
Go back to our homepage and we'll see it show up.

283
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.900
I didn't submit that one.

284
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.535
That's why it's not showing up there.

285
00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:30.440
Awesome.

286
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.270
So we got the R part of CRED, Read.

287
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.190
We've got the C part of CRED, which is Create.

288
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.910
Now let's go ahead and code up the edit screen.

289
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.120
If I want to change the price,

290
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.753
the name or the description of one of our items.
