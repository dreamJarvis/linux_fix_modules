00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.930
<v ->Alright, let's talk about deploying.</v>

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.470
This is not the easiest thing in the world

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.500
because we've got three different pieces

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.470
that we need to manage and get up on the internet.

5
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.300
Now normally with an application you either have

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.799
one deploy, you have a server-side rendered application

7
00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.250
and you just push that thing live.

8
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.330
Or you have two deploys where you have a rest back end.

9
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.100
That's an API and then you have react application

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.510
on the front end, so you've got your back end and front end.

11
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.450
In our case we have three because we have the Prisma Server

12
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.980
which also needs a MySQL database.

13
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.569
So that is going to be providing,

14
00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:35.930
that's where we deploy our schema to.

15
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.970
Then we have our Yoga Server which,

16
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.820
that has our Mutation and Query Resolvers in it.

17
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.570
And then we have our React application

18
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.710
which is actually a node server that runs next.js

19
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.070
and that makes sure that we can do

20
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.710
all of our server-side rendering.

21
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.894
So you get three different things to deploy.

22
00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:54.891
We're gonna jump in on that.

23
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:56.270
First thing we're gonna do is get

24
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.640
our Prisma Server up and running.

25
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.110
Then we'll do our Yoga Server and then

26
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.550
we'll do our React application.

27
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.300
So let's host this on Heroku.

28
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.420
The reason I'm choosing Heroku for this one is

29
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.405
because it will support both the front end

30
00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:11.435
of our application as well as our back end

31
00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:15.630
and Prisma has a tight integration with Heroku

32
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.670
which is really nice.

33
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.650
So what we want to do here is

34
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.250
sign into your Prisma back end.

35
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.030
These things, the servers that Prisma gives you,

36
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.380
these are just development servers.

37
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.642
You can't use these in production.

38
00:01:25.642 --> 00:01:28.450
You actually need to go ahead and host your own.

39
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.790
However you can use the Prisma dashboard

40
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.885
in order to manage the data and actually interface

41
00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.870
with your Prisma which is pretty nifty.

42
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.330
So we're going to go ahead and click on Add A Server.

43
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.250
You also have the ability to just create a Host It server

44
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.640
and put in your own MySQL database info in here.

45
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.827
But we are going to be clicking on Add A Server.

46
00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:53.827
And we're gonna create it, call it Sick Fits Production.

47
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.900
And then we will say a description.

48
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.530
Prod of Sick Fits.

49
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.150
You might have to call it something different

50
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.600
'cause I might have just taken it.

51
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.120
We're gonna go ahead and create a server.

52
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.380
We're going to, you can connect to an existing database

53
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.920
which if you connect to, you can host your own databases.

54
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.470
Or you can create a new database which is on Heroku.

55
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.250
So go ahead and you're gonna go do that.

56
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.743
And then you need to sign in with your Heroku account.

57
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.004
You can select the type of database,

58
00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.350
right now it's just postgreSQL,

59
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.750
but it should be MySQl and everything in the future.

60
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.200
You want to shoot where you want it to go.

61
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.360
And then I just want 10,000 rows for the hobby plan.

62
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.983
Obviously you can scale that up if you need more.

63
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.520
Run a click create database.

64
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.010
And you see that our database has been successfully created.

65
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.520
And now we need to set up the server,

66
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.630
so go ahead and click on set up server.

67
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.530
We're also going to use Heroku for this so click on that.

68
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.080
We're going to use the free, gonna create a server.

69
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.430
And you can imagine that if you were not going

70
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.150
through this little dialogue then you would

71
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.620
also need to set up a MySQL database

72
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.330
or get one from somewhere like Amazon AWS.

73
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.200
And then also set up a server that's

74
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.160
going to sit on top of your database here

75
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.460
and that's exactly where we're

76
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.270
putting both of these things on Heroku.

77
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.570
After a couple of minutes it told me

78
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.377
the Prisma server was successfully deployed,

79
00:03:32.377 --> 00:03:35.024
you can go ahead and view the server.

80
00:03:35.024 --> 00:03:37.750
And here it is, here's our Sick Fitz,

81
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.130
it looks like it's booting.

82
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.580
After a couple of minutes this shows up as healthy.

83
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.320
You can click through to it and you will see

84
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.660
that we have all the information here.

85
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.140
We now go to our services.

86
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.543
So we have this server here but we don't have

87
00:03:52.543 --> 00:03:56.470
the service which is our actual application.

88
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.511
So what we need to do is deploy

89
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:02.160
our application to this service.

90
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.240
So let's go into our backend and are going

91
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.840
to open it up on our terminal as well.

92
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.440
And normally when we deploy or run npm run deploy,

93
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.810
and that's going to deploy to our basic one.

94
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.580
But if you were to check out all of the commands

95
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.670
under Prisma if you have globally installed Prisma,

96
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.603
you say Prisma deploy, dash-dash-help.

97
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.760
You see all of the flats that we have for Prisma

98
00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:31.007
are dry-run, env-file, force.

99
00:04:31.007 --> 00:04:32.390
We are using the env-file because

100
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.520
if you look at your Prisma-dot-yml

101
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.240
we have environmental variables which we store

102
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.749
in this variables-dot-env file.

103
00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:42.360
So one kinda cool thing that we can do

104
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.360
is if you run Prisma deploy or npm run deploy

105
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.830
and then past the dash-dash-dash-n flag,

106
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.450
the dash-dash tells npm to append the following things

107
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.860
to the command that you're about to run.

108
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.178
And then we are appending the dash-n to the end.

109
00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:06.900
And that will run Prisma deploy, a regular command.

110
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.310
Hold on, hold, Prisma deploy, env-file variables the env.

111
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.040
And then we pass the dash-n onto the end.

112
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.182
And now Prisma says would you like to set up a new one

113
00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:20.980
or use and deploy an existing server?

114
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.829
And you can see there is our Sick Fits production.

115
00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:25.270
I'm going to click that.

116
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.840
Chose a name for your service.

117
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.013
I'm gonna call it Sick Fits Prod.

118
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.043
Stage: Prod.

119
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.000
And it looks like it pushed everything

120
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.730
up and we should be able to take a look.

121
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.400
Refresh our list of services here.

122
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.390
And now we see our production in here.

123
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.420
And there's gonna be no data in here

124
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.577
but you do see that our schema has

125
00:05:58.577 --> 00:06:01.400
now been pushed up to this.

126
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.420
If you head back to your Prisma-dot-yml file

127
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.710
you'll see that it commented out our old one here.

128
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.520
And then also put in our new endpoint

129
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.637
which is the Heroku app that we're going towards.

130
00:06:12.637 --> 00:06:15.460
We also do want to put a secret on that

131
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.230
so I'm going to actually comment that out.

132
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.331
So npm run deploy, don't use the dash-n there.

133
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:22.410
It's going to deploy it to our

134
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.320
Heroku now with the new secret.

135
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.426
Looks like everything works.

136
00:06:26.426 --> 00:06:30.180
So that is deploying our back end to our Heroku.

137
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.580
That's probably the easiest way you can do it.

138
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.630
Obviously you can host, Prisma's all open source.

139
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.500
You can host your own, there's docker images

140
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.650
that you'll be able to use but that for me

141
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.086
is the most straight forward way to go ahead

142
00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:43.070
and deploy the back end.

143
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.820
So let's get into using our Yoga Server.

144
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.390
We're gonna put that on Heroku as well.

145
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.340
And then finally our React application.
