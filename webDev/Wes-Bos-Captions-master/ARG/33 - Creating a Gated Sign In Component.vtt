00:00:01.177 --> 00:00:02.571
<v ->All right, in this video we're gonna make</v>

2
00:00:02.571 --> 00:00:05.896
a wrapper component that will check if someone is signed in,

3
00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:08.824
and that way we can put components on the page.

4
00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:10.530
And if someone's not signed in it's just gonna

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.602
tell them to go ahead and sign in.

6
00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:17.749
So, we're gonna open up our sidebar here and we're gonna

7
00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:22.749
make a new component called PleaseSignIn.js and we're

8
00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:25.425
gonna need a couple things here first we wanna import query

9
00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:29.442
from react-apollo then we wanna import the current user

10
00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:31.979
query from the user component cause we're gonna have

11
00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:36.081
to check if the current user is signed in.

12
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:40.664
We're gonna import that sign in component from sign in.

13
00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:46.689
Then we're gonna make our component const PleaseSignIn is

14
00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:47.939
equal to props.

15
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:54.374
And then we'll export default PleaseSignIn.

16
00:00:56.123 --> 00:01:00.451
From here we'll just return a please sign in.

17
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:02.708
Alright, let's see how we're doing now we'll go to the sell

18
00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:07.458
page and we will import PleaseSignIn from our components.

19
00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:17.105
And then we're just gonna wrap the whatever component you

20
00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:20.431
want to make sure the user is signed in with we're just

21
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:23.780
going to wrap so we're gonna say please sign in.

22
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.004
Put the CreateItem inside of it then I'm going to sign out

23
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.921
and manually go to the forward slash sell page.

24
00:01:33.803 --> 00:01:35.876
And you can see it's gonna tell us simply sign in.

25
00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:39.907
So the idea with this PleaseSignIn is if we inside of that

26
00:01:39.907 --> 00:01:41.907
let's just return a div.

27
00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.597
Inside of that we just return

28
00:01:45.597 --> 00:01:50.503
props.children it's just going to return whatever is

29
00:01:50.503 --> 00:01:54.247
has been wrapped in it right so the child of PleaseSignIn is

30
00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:57.559
this CreateItem component and then we're just showing it

31
00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:01.947
so we sorta need to do a quick check before we do anything.

32
00:02:01.947 --> 00:02:03.905
So actually we're gonna get rid of all this we're gonna

33
00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:07.275
give ourselves a query component and then the query is

34
00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:10.192
going to be the current user query.

35
00:02:12.283 --> 00:02:15.450
Then inside of that we have a function

36
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.298
that has our data and our loading and inside

37
00:02:20.298 --> 00:02:23.911
of that we're gonna say if there is loading return paragraph

38
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:28.314
loading otherwise we're going to check if the user is

39
00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.231
signed in so if there is no data.me

40
00:02:33.097 --> 00:02:35.847
then we are going to return a div

41
00:02:38.714 --> 00:02:42.327
that says paragraph please sign in before

42
00:02:42.327 --> 00:02:46.025
continuing and then we're just gonna pop in the SignIn

43
00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:49.405
component that's the beauty of using React is that we can

44
00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:52.647
put the SignIn component wherever it is that we possibly

45
00:02:52.647 --> 00:02:56.022
would want and so finally otherwise if they are signed in

46
00:02:56.022 --> 00:02:58.983
we simply just wanna like bypass this component

47
00:02:58.983 --> 00:03:02.608
entirely and just return the props.children.

48
00:03:02.608 --> 00:03:04.025
Now I get a bit of an error here.

49
00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:07.072
Element type is invalid, expected string for built-in

50
00:03:07.072 --> 00:03:10.265
components, you likely forgot to export your component.

51
00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:12.435
Okay so let's debug this real quick.

52
00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:16.828
Something is being returned from here that is not nice so

53
00:03:16.828 --> 00:03:19.936
what I like to do in this case is just first check if

54
00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:23.788
this is working so it's at the top return paragraph hey.

55
00:03:23.788 --> 00:03:27.456
That works okay, good now if I were to get rid of this whole

56
00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:30.364
chunk here would it work?

57
00:03:30.364 --> 00:03:33.135
Okay good so it's obviously the error is somewhere in here

58
00:03:33.135 --> 00:03:36.316
and I'm willing to bet it's this component if I delete that

59
00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:37.961
component does it work?

60
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:42.735
It does but if I leave it in it breaks so SignIn oh I see

61
00:03:42.735 --> 00:03:46.780
if we open up our SignIn.js you see it's exported default

62
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.585
I imported it as a named import with curly brackets so

63
00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:53.452
we'll take those off and I bet it'll all work.

64
00:03:53.452 --> 00:03:56.508
Beautiful so here we are on the sell page this says please

65
00:03:56.508 --> 00:04:00.652
sign in before continuing then we get the actual sign in

66
00:04:00.652 --> 00:04:01.569
thing here.

67
00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:04.193
I can try to sign in.

68
00:04:09.794 --> 00:04:12.578
You see we're signed in here although this still shows

69
00:04:12.578 --> 00:04:15.820
please sign in before continuing so what I'm wondering

70
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.584
is is this query working properly the way that we can debug

71
00:04:19.584 --> 00:04:23.777
that is just console log the data and see if that's actually

72
00:04:23.777 --> 00:04:28.583
getting some data so if we were to refresh both times

73
00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:31.000
we get the data do we get me?

74
00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:38.273
Oh I see why it's cause I did not de-structure this this is

75
00:04:38.273 --> 00:04:42.126
the payload and not two arguments but if I de-structure

76
00:04:42.126 --> 00:04:46.926
that payload into data and loading I bet it will work.

77
00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:50.513
There we go so now we have the sell so if I sign out it

78
00:04:50.513 --> 00:04:53.009
immediately shows us the sign into your account.

79
00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.607
If I sign in it immediately shows us the sale page so it's

80
00:04:57.607 --> 00:05:00.583
nice to be able to flip-flop and what we're gonna do later

81
00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:03.844
is extend this PleaseSignIn to also handle different

82
00:05:03.844 --> 00:05:07.530
permissions that the user may have but for now it's a nice

83
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.759
simple wrapper component that we can use on all of our

84
00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.614
pages that need someone to be signed in before that

85
00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:16.697
actual component is actually being displayed.
