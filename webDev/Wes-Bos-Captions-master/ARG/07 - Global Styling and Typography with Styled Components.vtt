00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.270
<v Presenter>One of the reasons people don't</v>

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.330
necessarily like the whole idea of CSS in JS

3
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.340
is because it scopes things.

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.793
Like, one of the benefits to CSS in JS

5
00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:11.500
is that it is scoping things.

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.599
Meaning that if you apply a specific style to this header,

7
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.010
no other H1 on the page is going to have that styles

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.961
leak into it unless you explicitly give it those styles.

9
00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:26.001
And there's sort of this other argument on the other side

10
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:30.467
where people say, well, do you know what CSS stands for?

11
00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.663
It's cascading.

12
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.536
How do you spell it?

13
00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:38.620
It is Cascading Style Sheets.

14
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.072
And the cascading means that you can apply

15
00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:43.282
styles at a very high level, maybe at a page level,

16
00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:45.970
and then they'll apply to everything on the page.

17
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.540
That's the beauty of CSS,

18
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.270
and you can totally do that in CSS in JS.

19
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.505
In fact, I recommend it because things

20
00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:55.760
like setting font colors and font sizes

21
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.142
and typography and resetting boarders

22
00:01:00.142 --> 00:01:03.022
and margin and padding all of that stuff,

23
00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:05.430
it's not something that you should have to

24
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.080
redo every single time that you

25
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.328
crack open a style component,

26
00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:10.013
because that gets really repetitive,

27
00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:11.486
and it gets very hard to manage if

28
00:01:11.486 --> 00:01:13.988
you were to ever change one of those things like the font.

29
00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:18.982
So what I'm going to do now is to do some global styling,

30
00:01:18.982 --> 00:01:22.455
and I tend to just reset my padding,

31
00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:24.743
set background colors, set font sizes,

32
00:01:24.743 --> 00:01:27.230
and set typography globally,

33
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.820
and then all of my other styles will live in components.

34
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.722
And that's why we've imported this

35
00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:34.830
injectGlobal function that we have here,

36
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.180
and it's coming from styled components.

37
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.884
Actually this is red because it's sort of a best practice

38
00:01:38.884 --> 00:01:42.738
to always import your packages first

39
00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:47.640
and then import your local components after that.

40
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.220
So I have a little ESLint rule that will

41
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.910
yell at me if I accidentally do that.

42
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.628
Similarly it will give me a warning

43
00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:54.580
if I have an unused piece.

44
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.582
In this case I have not used injectGlobal yet.

45
00:01:56.582 --> 00:02:00.003
However, now we simply need to go ahead and use it,

46
00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.460
so anywhere on this page.

47
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.760
This is a little bit weird because

48
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.200
you don't assign it to a variable

49
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.290
and set it somewhere.

50
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.338
You just need to call it anywhere in your application,

51
00:02:08.338 --> 00:02:11.440
and that's going to inject the global CSS.

52
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.317
We simply call it injectGlobal,

53
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.300
and we'll go ahead and write some selectors.

54
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.687
Make sure you actually write your selector here

55
00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:21.190
and not just start doing something, like background:red,

56
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.024
because that's not going to be applied to anything.

57
00:02:23.024 --> 00:02:26.021
Because this is global CSS, you do need your selector,

58
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:31.021
and then inside of that we'll say box-sizing: border-box,

59
00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:35.198
and font-size: 10px,

60
00:02:35.198 --> 00:02:37.510
and that's going to set the base

61
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.400
font of the document as 10px

62
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.450
and then I'm going to use rems as a base 10.

63
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.545
I'll come back to that in a second.

64
00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:47.000
Next we want to select star.

65
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.793
We want to star before and star after.

66
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.740
And what that's going to do is we can grab our box sizing

67
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.140
and change that to inherit.

68
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.780
Apparently this is the best way to set box sizing

69
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.440
border box on absolutely everything

70
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.447
is set it on the root of your document in HTML

71
00:03:04.447 --> 00:03:08.790
and then inherit it on absolutely everything else.

72
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.020
Then we want to select our body,

73
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.287
and on that body we'll do padding: 0, margin: 0,

74
00:03:14.287 --> 00:03:15.610
and if we give this a save,

75
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.049
we should now see that the margin that we had before.

76
00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.883
If we comment these out,

77
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.240
we see that we do have some padding

78
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.393
to the left and to the right on that body.

79
00:03:27.393 --> 00:03:31.373
Then we put 'em back on, they will be totally gone.

80
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.348
We want to set the font size to 1.5rem,

81
00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:38.391
and the reason why I did it 10px here

82
00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:40.860
is so that everything is base 10 for me,

83
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.340
and that I know 1.5rem is going to be 15 pixels

84
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.239
and I don't have to do the math,

85
00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.562
'cause I believe the base font size for

86
00:03:47.562 --> 00:03:49.850
the browser is something like 16,

87
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.156
and then you're always working base 16

88
00:03:52.156 --> 00:03:53.839
and I'm not that good at math.

89
00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:58.643
We'll set a line height to 2.

90
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.200
Things are starting to look good.

91
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.824
Let's actually tackle font family,

92
00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:05.296
and how do you do custom fonts?

93
00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:08.330
If you take a look at your static folder,

94
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.219
you'll see that I have this red Nika Next

95
00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.640
web font there for you.

96
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.207
So we wanna load that in ourselves.

97
00:04:14.207 --> 00:04:16.420
And the way that you do that is just like you did

98
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.850
within any normal CSS, so we define a font face

99
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.707
and we name it the font-family as rednika_next.

100
00:04:33.303 --> 00:04:34.290
Say the source of that is URL,

101
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.290
and we're going to go to the root /static/rednikanext woff,

102
00:04:41.324 --> 00:04:45.183
and the format is going to be woff2.

103
00:04:46.027 --> 00:04:47.960
That's all we need to support

104
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.270
the latest and greatest browsers.

105
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.114
And then font-weight is going to be normal,

106
00:04:51.114 --> 00:04:56.114
and the font-style is going to be normal.

107
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.243
Now we should be able to just take this font family

108
00:04:59.243 --> 00:05:01.731
and pop it either on our document.

109
00:05:01.731 --> 00:05:03.252
Our HTML, doesn't really matter,

110
00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:04.810
and that should change.

111
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.643
There we go.

112
00:05:05.643 --> 00:05:08.281
We got this red Nika Next font popping up for us.

113
00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:10.090
I'm pretty happy about that.

114
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.381
Let's select our anchor links,

115
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:15.397
and we'll say text-decoration: none.

116
00:05:15.397 --> 00:05:17.453
Take off that underline.

117
00:05:17.453 --> 00:05:22.453
Color is going to be the theme black that we have.

118
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.119
And normally you would do something like this

119
00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:26.236
where you would grab the props.

120
00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:28.780
You'll say props.theme.black.

121
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.520
However, that is not going to work,

122
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.360
and I'll tell you why.

123
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.556
Make sure you put a semicolon there.

124
00:05:32.556 --> 00:05:34.454
Because we're not inside of

125
00:05:34.454 --> 00:05:36.348
the theme provider at this point.

126
00:05:36.348 --> 00:05:38.647
Any component inside of the theme provider

127
00:05:38.647 --> 00:05:41.141
can have access to this props.theme,

128
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:43.573
however, because we're just injecting global

129
00:05:43.573 --> 00:05:45.359
or settings in global styles here,

130
00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:48.174
we don't have access to that props.theme.black.

131
00:05:48.174 --> 00:05:51.227
However, luckily it's in the same file,

132
00:05:51.227 --> 00:05:53.550
so it's within scope of this module,

133
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.949
and I'm able to just access the theme variable

134
00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.130
and the black on top of it.

135
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.240
If that wasn't the case,

136
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.203
you'd have to export it from this file

137
00:06:01.203 --> 00:06:05.030
and then import it in or refactor it out into its own file.

138
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.321
So let's go back and we can just replace

139
00:06:07.321 --> 00:06:09.438
all of this with just theme.black,

140
00:06:09.438 --> 00:06:13.114
and things are starting to look good.

141
00:06:13.114 --> 00:06:15.500
Let me just double check my answer here.

142
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.637
Make sure we've got all of

143
00:06:16.637 --> 00:06:19.373
the styles that we're looking for.

144
00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:24.160
Looks like we're in good shape.

145
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.609
Next what we need to do is spend

146
00:06:26.609 --> 00:06:30.163
a bit of time styling up our nav.

147
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.320
Let's crack open up the nav.js

148
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.249
and you'll see that I also have given you this file

149
00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:40.659
called NavStyles where I'm just creating a unordered list

150
00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:43.620
and inside of that we have a whole bunch.

151
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.752
I have display: flex on it, I have justified it to the end.

152
00:06:46.752 --> 00:06:49.454
I've styled both links and buttons

153
00:06:49.454 --> 00:06:52.790
that live in the nav are going to look exactly the same

154
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:53.910
and I'll show you why.

155
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.076
It's because this cart button.

156
00:06:55.076 --> 00:06:56.552
That's actually a button.

157
00:06:56.552 --> 00:06:58.697
And then the rest of them are actually,

158
00:06:58.697 --> 00:07:01.190
well, I don't have it running right now,

159
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.110
but the rest of them are actually just links.

160
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.574
So I've selected both of them to run at the exact same time.

161
00:07:06.574 --> 00:07:08.583
There's a couple of media queries in here.

162
00:07:08.583 --> 00:07:12.686
And what else is kind of interesting?

163
00:07:12.686 --> 00:07:15.592
This little cool underline dealie

164
00:07:15.592 --> 00:07:18.955
when you underline something it will be red.

165
00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:22.520
That's using the after pseudo-element.

166
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.980
I've made it 2 pixels high,

167
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.273
and I've just done some tricky trickerson

168
00:07:26.273 --> 00:07:30.727
in my CSS in order to make that work.

169
00:07:30.727 --> 00:07:32.857
So there's not a whole lot going on here.

170
00:07:32.857 --> 00:07:35.135
I'm not gonna sit here and spend half an hour

171
00:07:35.135 --> 00:07:36.691
typing this all out for you.

172
00:07:36.691 --> 00:07:39.851
Just know that a lot of the style components

173
00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:41.475
that I've given you for this course,

174
00:07:41.475 --> 00:07:44.830
they already live in this styles folder

175
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.960
and we'll be pulling upon them for the rest of this course.

176
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.687
And we'll still be writing some CSS,

177
00:07:50.687 --> 00:07:52.800
but a majority of it will be in here.

178
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.704
So let's go into our nav here

179
00:07:54.704 --> 00:07:58.580
and let's go ahead and import that component.

180
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.223
So NavStyles from, whoops,

181
00:08:06.303 --> 00:08:07.136
NavStyles.

182
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.120
And then we'll swap out this div with the NavStyles.

183
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.183
This is actually gonna be an unordered list.

184
00:08:15.183 --> 00:08:16.770
Give that a save.

185
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.873
Let's see how we, oh ho, look at that.

186
00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.122
It's already looking way better.

187
00:08:20.122 --> 00:08:21.970
You've got this kind of,

188
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.230
oh, that's actually another cool thing.

189
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.800
Let me show you how I got those angled lines.

190
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.150
I thought that was, I was pretty proud of that.

191
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.233
Skew 20 degrees.

192
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.990
No.

193
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.053
I think it is skew.

194
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.497
Yeah, so just by skewing, I used to think I would have to

195
00:08:42.497 --> 00:08:47.497
take the before element, which is just this gray line

196
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.440
and I had to rotate it and then stretch it to fit.

197
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.227
But apparently just by doing skew, it will both rotate it

198
00:08:53.227 --> 00:08:55.780
from the center and make sure that

199
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.680
they hit perfectly top and bottom.

200
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.860
I was pretty happy about learning that.

201
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.237
So we have all of our elements in here,

202
00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:04.603
and then inside of our nav we simply just need to have links

203
00:09:04.603 --> 00:09:09.440
to all of the different things that are on our site.

204
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.067
So let's take a quick look.

205
00:09:12.067 --> 00:09:15.195
We have items, we have sell, we have signup, we have orders,

206
00:09:15.195 --> 00:09:17.680
and we have account.

207
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.520
And these are gonna be shown and hidden

208
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.610
based on if the user is logged in or not,

209
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.983
but for now we're just gonna wrap

210
00:09:22.983 --> 00:09:25.490
each of them in a link tag.

211
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.893
So I'm going to get rid of these links right here

212
00:09:27.893 --> 00:09:32.893
and we're just going to write some link tags.

213
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.155
Href equals forward slash that.

214
00:09:37.155 --> 00:09:39.340
Then inside of each of these,

215
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.854
we have a anchor link that goes to nothing

216
00:09:42.854 --> 00:09:45.680
and then the word, and we'll go through each of these.

217
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.620
So items.

218
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.830
This is going to be sell.

219
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.467
This will just be signup.

220
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.488
This will be orders.

221
00:09:56.488 --> 00:10:00.073
And this would be account.

222
00:10:01.638 --> 00:10:02.970
Bam.

223
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.582
Obviously these aren't gonna work if you click on them.

224
00:10:04.582 --> 00:10:06.850
You're gonna get an error.

225
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.030
An unexpected error has occurred,

226
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.554
'cause they don't exist just yet.

227
00:10:09.554 --> 00:10:13.816
Only the home page and the sell page will currently work.

228
00:10:13.816 --> 00:10:16.468
But we are gonna come back and create all of these pages

229
00:10:16.468 --> 00:10:20.350
plus a couple more for administrative purposes.

230
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.270
Things are starting to look pretty good now.

231
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.866
Let's jump into a couple more things with the routing

232
00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:28.353
and then we're good for graphic UL.
