00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:02.843
<v Wes>Alright.</v>

3
00:00:02.843 --> 00:00:04.210
We have a bit of a problem now where if you

4
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.170
put an item into your cart and you try to delete

5
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.330
that item, first, we get an error that says

6
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.619
the change you are trying to make would violate

7
00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.600
the cart to item between cart and item,

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.490
and second, if we are actually able to delete it,

9
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.040
well then what do we do if it's in somebody's cart?

10
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.230
We need to somehow show that that item

11
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.630
has been removed or just remove it from the cart entirely.

12
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.450
Let's first fix this right here and I believe

13
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.063
that's in our...let's go to our backend here.

14
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.830
Open up our Data Model and find our cart item.

15
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.030
This is saying the item is absolutely required

16
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.060
with a bang on it and I think we are wrong

17
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.180
in that because it is possible to have a cart

18
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.880
item where the item has been deleted

19
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.430
and therefore, does not exist.

20
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.560
Lets take that requirement away and

21
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.563
give out a save and lets go redeploy it.

22
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.200
Gonna start it up again and now when I try

23
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.200
to delete an item, it actually deletes that item.

24
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.200
You still see it here 'cause we haven't refetched

25
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.713
the cart, but if I give the page a refresh,

26
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.370
now we get bit of an error here, cannot read property

27
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.720
image of null and it's because its trying to pull

28
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.620
the item's image when the item doesn't exist.

29
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.213
Lets go to our front end here, open up our cart dot JS,

30
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.930
and open up our cart item dot JS, and we'll simply just go

31
00:01:36.487 --> 00:01:41.487
up here and we'll change this to a return

32
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.210
and we'll change this to a block with curly-brackets.

33
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.280
Then above here we will need to first

34
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.096
check if that item exists.

35
00:01:58.096 --> 00:02:01.411
If there was no cart item dot item, we'll just return

36
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:06.411
null or you could return a paragraph tag that says

37
00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:12.235
this item has been removed.

38
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.654
There ya go.

39
00:02:17.654 --> 00:02:19.710
It just says this item has been removed, you could probably

40
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.462
also take the cart item styles instead

41
00:02:21.462 --> 00:02:26.462
of the paragraph and just wrap it in a cart-item styles.

42
00:02:30.368 --> 00:02:33.020
Then we get bit of a nice little one, actually,

43
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.883
you could probably even further have the remove from cart

44
00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:40.883
button inside of here so that if somebody does want it...

45
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.270
there ya go...I can still remove the item from my cart

46
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.730
even if it is being removed.

47
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.610
Lookin' good.

48
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.100
Okay, that's the solving of that issue.

49
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.700
If you really wanted to you could also do a refetch

50
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.000
of the current user's cart, but I am gonna leave it at that.

51
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.810
The next video we're gonna look at the Render Prop

52
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.053
mess that we sort of have ourselves in.
