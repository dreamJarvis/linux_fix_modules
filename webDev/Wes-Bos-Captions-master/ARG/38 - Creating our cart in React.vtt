00:00:01.125 --> 00:00:02.176
<v Wes>Alright, we're flippin' over</v>

2
00:00:02.176 --> 00:00:04.288
to working on the shopping cart.

3
00:00:04.288 --> 00:00:06.979
First we're gonna start off with just the visual part of it,

4
00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.083
building it out in React,

5
00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:09.279
and then we're gonna circle back

6
00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:12.379
and actually hook up the adding to cart,

7
00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.827
pulling the items out of cart,

8
00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:14.944
listing the items that are in cart,

9
00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:15.979
removing them from cart.

10
00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:18.673
There's a whole bunch that is gonna be going on here.

11
00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:21.374
So, first, before we even get into that, let's go ahead

12
00:00:21.374 --> 00:00:24.045
and just add yourself in, I dunno,

13
00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:28.545
five or six different items, and then we'll get going.

14
00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:46.635
Alright, so we need to open up our header.js

15
00:00:46.635 --> 00:00:48.700
which is where our cart is gonna go into,

16
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.309
and then we also need to make a new component.

17
00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.369
Let's go into the components folder

18
00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:55.901
and create a new file called, cap LC cart.js*

19
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:58.857
and inside of there, we're gonna import

20
00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:00.818
a couple styled components, so first of all

21
00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:03.947
import React from react and we need

22
00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:06.081
four different style components that we have.

23
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:08.581
We need one called CartStyles.

24
00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:12.654
We need another one called Supreme.

25
00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:16.733
We need another one called CloseButton.

26
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.774
We need another one called SickButton,

27
00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:20.690
which we've used before.

28
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.023
Import all of those, import from styles.

29
00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:30.554
Okay, so all I'm doing there is I just wrote them all,

30
00:01:30.554 --> 00:01:33.752
I copied them and then I paste them in as I need them.

31
00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:35.775
Then we'll make our cart.

32
00:01:35.775 --> 00:01:40.775
Const Cart is equal to let's use a stateless component here.

33
00:01:41.037 --> 00:01:43.479
Actually, it's gonna need a block

34
00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.479
and then I'm just gonna return from that our CartStyles

35
00:01:48.762 --> 00:01:53.095
inside of that just do a header, regular header tag,

36
00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:56.413
inside of that give yourselves a CloseButton,

37
00:01:56.413 --> 00:02:00.746
custom component, that needs a title called "close".

38
00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:04.801
And inside of there I'm going to use my

39
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:06.845
ampersand times, that will give us that

40
00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:10.432
nice little x to close the actual cart.

41
00:02:10.432 --> 00:02:12.494
Then below, we're gonna use Supreme,

42
00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:15.661
which is just an H3 if you open it up.

43
00:02:16.755 --> 00:02:20.755
It's just a styled H3 with some fanciness in it.

44
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.418
That's going to say Your Cart,

45
00:02:25.418 --> 00:02:26.991
and we're going to go back and swap out Your

46
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:30.754
with your actual name once we have the queries rolling.

47
00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:32.227
Underneath that, we'll just have a paragraph tag

48
00:02:32.227 --> 00:02:35.455
that says You Have, let's just say underscore underscore

49
00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.038
Items in your cart.

50
00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:43.291
Gonna fill that out with the actual number of items.

51
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:47.328
Below that we need a footer, we need a paragraph tag,

52
00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:52.328
let's just put 11, let's just put ten dollars and ten cents.

53
00:02:54.113 --> 00:02:57.351
Obviously, this is going to be swapped out

54
00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:59.262
with the actual value of our cart.

55
00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.149
And then we need a SickButton inside of that,

56
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:03.816
as just a check out.

57
00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.449
I think that's good, then we can go ahead and

58
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:14.769
export default cart and, one other thing is that

59
00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.348
this cart style needs an open prop pass to it,

60
00:03:19.348 --> 00:03:21.196
and it's gonna either gonna be true or false,

61
00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:22.431
and I'll show you what that is.

62
00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:26.887
Let's open up the CartStyles and this is just

63
00:03:26.887 --> 00:03:29.219
our CartStyles, it's a style div.

64
00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.469
And inside of it, we will automatically

65
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.708
translate x 100 percent, and what that's gonna do is

66
00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:40.339
that's gonna put it off screen.

67
00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:42.003
However, if it has a prop of open,

68
00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:44.201
it's going to transform it zero,

69
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.783
and that will bring it back on screen.

70
00:03:45.783 --> 00:03:47.715
So let's just see how that looks.

71
00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:51.942
We'll head back to our header and import the cart.

72
00:03:51.942 --> 00:03:54.525
We'll go NProgress up, that up,

73
00:03:55.455 --> 00:03:59.236
then we'll import the cart, we'll go down,

74
00:03:59.236 --> 00:04:03.114
into our header, right where it says cart,

75
00:04:03.114 --> 00:04:06.577
we can replace that with a cart tag.

76
00:04:06.577 --> 00:04:11.410
And CartStyle is not defined, let's jump back to our cart.

77
00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:16.578
There's an s on that.

78
00:04:16.578 --> 00:04:18.822
Hey, there we go.

79
00:04:18.822 --> 00:04:19.748
So this is what our cart looks like.

80
00:04:19.748 --> 00:04:22.415
Obviously I've done the styles to put this button

81
00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:24.644
in the top right hand corner.

82
00:04:24.644 --> 00:04:25.784
You have this title that says your cart,

83
00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:28.075
here it's gonna tell us how many items in our cart.

84
00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:30.389
Then in between here, we're going to loop over

85
00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.628
the items in our cart and display them.

86
00:04:32.628 --> 00:04:34.391
And then finally we have a total,

87
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:36.660
as well as a button that will allow us to

88
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.357
consummate the transaction.

89
00:04:39.357 --> 00:04:42.735
You see that we take this open and

90
00:04:42.735 --> 00:04:45.726
either remove it or set it to false.

91
00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:48.567
The cart will go offscreen, bring it back,

92
00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:51.516
it will put it back on screen.

93
00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:52.816
And that's the whole point, that we're gonna be

94
00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:56.101
setting up booley in here that's gonna live in our

95
00:04:56.101 --> 00:04:59.608
palostore, that can be toggled between true and false

96
00:04:59.608 --> 00:05:02.333
and whenever that's changed anywhere on our page,

97
00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.966
this thing will trigger a re-render and it will,

98
00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:08.466
it will apply that CSS to put it off page.

99
00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:21.805
So that's exactly what we're gonna do in the next video.

100
00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:25.169
We're gonna jump into getting local state

101
00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.086
to also live in our Apollo client.
