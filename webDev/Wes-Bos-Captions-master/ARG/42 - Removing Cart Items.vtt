1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.690
<v Instructor>Right now we're going to take a look at</v>

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.390
how we can actually remove items from

3
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.110
our cart with a button.

4
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.040
First thing we wanna do is open up our schema.

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.380
We're on the backend here.

6
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.946
We're gonna go down to our mutation and just create

7
00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:16.660
a removeFromCart, the ticks and an ID,

8
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.040
very much like it, and it's going to

9
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.610
return that cart item.

10
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.150
It's gonna return the removed cart item.

11
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.940
I'll show you why in the next video,

12
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.790
why it's important to remove the cart item.

13
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.623
Give that a save.

14
00:00:27.623 --> 00:00:29.943
Let's open up our mutation.js and code up

15
00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:33.343
a resolver that matches that removeFromCart.

16
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:35.910
Go here, make an async function called

17
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.910
removeFromCart, parent, args, ctx, info.

18
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.173
Fino.

19
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.233
Inside of here, we need to do three things.

20
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:53.200
First we need to find the cart item.

21
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.270
Second, we need to make sure they

22
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.100
own that cart item.

23
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.120
We don't want people deleting items from their cart

24
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.920
if they're not their cart.

25
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.320
And then third, we wanna actually

26
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.210
delete that cart item.

27
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.320
This one's a pretty simple one, I would say.

28
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.150
So if you want a little bit of a challenge,

29
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.900
maybe try to code this up yourself

30
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.160
and then meet me back.

31
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.150
Otherwise let's do it right now.

32
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.750
First thing is find the cart item,

33
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.270
so const cartItem is equal to await.

34
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.110
Don't forget that; remember we did that once?

35
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.040
That sucked.

36
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.163
Ctx.db.query.cartItem,

37
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.453
because we know the ID of the item

38
00:01:35.453 --> 00:01:38.300
because it's gonna come in via the args.

39
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.180
We just coded up the schema saying when someone

40
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.490
calls removeFromCart, we're going to accept an ID.

41
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.570
That's why we are grabbing the argument ID.

42
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.530
For that cart item, we actually wanna grab

43
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.400
the who owns the cart item.

44
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.930
So instead of passing info here

45
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.210
because our final query is not going to

46
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.660
ask for the user, just for the basics,

47
00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.790
we really just need the ID.

48
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.410
But here we need to know the user's ID that owns it,

49
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.350
so we pass a manual query here,

50
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.160
and that is we want the ID of the cart item.

51
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.520
We also want the user of the cart item

52
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.390
along with the user's ID.

53
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.380
Next, we need to make sure they own that cart item.

54
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.700
But actually, before we even do that,

55
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.080
let's do a 1.5 here.

56
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.840
Make sure we found an item,

57
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.110
because this is a possibility that someone

58
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.360
hit this endpoint without actually

59
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.070
giving us an ID, and then we don't wanna

60
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.950
move forward with anything.

61
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.310
So we say if there's no cart item,

62
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.113
we'll just throw a new error,

63
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.683
No CartItem Found!

64
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.200
Cool.

65
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.490
Two, make sure that they own it.

66
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.370
So we'll say if the cartItem.user.id,

67
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.270
so if the cart item's user ID doesn't equal

68
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.270
the ctx.request.userId, then we're just going to

69
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.997
throw a new error, Cheatin huhhhh.

70
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.750
In this case, we don't necessarily have to

71
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.170
check that they're logged in

72
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.130
because you'll always have a request,

73
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.050
and if there is no user ID, then it's still gonna

74
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.840
throw that Cheatin huhhhh error that we have.

75
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.940
And then third, we wanna actually delete that item.

76
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.840
So we're just gonna return the promise from here.

77
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.973
Ctx.db.mutation.deleteCartItem.

78
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.710
Remember, if we go to our generated prisma.graphql,

79
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.000
there's going to be a mutation called deleteCartItem

80
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.810
and that takes a where where the ID is there.

81
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.570
So we'll say delete the cart item

82
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.013
where the ID is equal to the args.id.

83
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.830
And then we'll pass the info,

84
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.560
which is the query that's coming in

85
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.080
from the client side, and that should be

86
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.460
enough for us to do that.

87
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.650
Let's flip over to the client side,

88
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.120
so go to yellow.

89
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.989
We're gonna create a new component called

90
00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.239
RemoveFromCart.

91
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.130
Go to my components, RemoveFromCart.js.

92
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.343
Import React from react.

93
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.483
Import our mutation from react-apollo.

94
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.530
We're gonna do a little bit of styling,

95
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.600
so import styled-components, import PropTypes,

96
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.240
import gql, and then finally we wanna import

97
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.618
the current user query.

98
00:04:20.618 --> 00:04:21.680
I'm gonna show you in the next video

99
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.783
why we're doing that.

100
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.243
Now go ahead and make our RemoveFromCart.

101
00:04:28.753 --> 00:04:29.700
It's going to have a render.

102
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.700
Let's export default RemoveFromCart immediately.

103
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.190
What else do we need in here?

104
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.090
We need a button that's a styled component,

105
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.006
so const, we'll call it a BigButton,

106
00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:42.283
the styled.button.

107
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.070
And inside of that, let's make font size 3rem,

108
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.440
background none, border none,

109
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.430
and we wanna just change the color

110
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.623
when someone hovers.

111
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.823
So we'll just say color, grab it from our theme, red.

112
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.973
Say cursor, pointer.

113
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.117
Inside of this render, we'll return a BigButton.

114
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.543
Has a title of Delete Item.

115
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.410
And then inside of that,

116
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.810
I'll just render out a times symbol.

117
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.250
All right, I think I'm in pretty good shape

118
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.780
just to get something showing up on the page.

119
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.840
Let's open up our CartItem component

120
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.213
and import that RemoveFromCart button.

121
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.420
Scroll right below the closing div

122
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.830
above the CartItemStyles and let's give ourselves

123
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.563
a RemoveFromCart button.

124
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.710
The one thing that we will have to pass to

125
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.620
this RemoveFromCart button is the ID of

126
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.850
the item that we wish to remove.

127
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.010
Sorry, the ID of the cart item that we wish to remove.

128
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.260
So we'll say ID is equal to cartItem.id,

129
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.840
and then let's also make sure that

130
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.480
we're going to accept that via propTypes.

131
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.480
Up here, just gonna say static propTypes is equal to,

132
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.720
gonna grab an ID, which is a PropTypes.string

133
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.923
and that's required.

134
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
And things are looking good.

135
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.010
We've got this button here.

136
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.660
When you click it, it obviously does nothing,

137
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.410
but that's going to allow us to remove it.

138
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.652
Next step is that we need to code up a query

139
00:06:32.652 --> 00:06:35.780
for our mutation that will run

140
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.030
when somebody clicks it.

141
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.453
Let's do that above here.

142
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.053
We'll call it Remove From Cart Mutation.

143
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.850
Then we'll call up removeFromCart method,

144
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.900
we'll pass the ID along for the ride,

145
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.140
and then all we care about getting back is

146
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.460
the ID of the item that was deleted.

147
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.680
We don't care about what the title

148
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.200
or the description or the image of

149
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.310
the removed cart item is.

150
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.310
Give that a save, then we can take our mutation

151
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.630
and infuse this thing into it.

152
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.843
We'll go to our BigButton here,

153
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.223
give ourselves a mutation.

154
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.503
Mutation is equal to Remove From Cart Mutation.

155
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.283
And the child of this is an arrow function.

156
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.660
That will give us a removeFromCart method.

157
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.223
I'll also de-structure the loading and the error.

158
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.400
We'll bring our button inside of here.

159
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.233
I goofed something up.

160
00:07:41.842 --> 00:07:43.200
(sings)

161
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.943
Mutation equals remove.

162
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.323
That; there we go.

163
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.740
Then when somebody clicks this button ...

164
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.550
So we'll take this button here,

165
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.470
say onClick is equal to,

166
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.770
and I'm gonna do a little arrow function here.

167
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.600
We will first call the removeFromCart method.

168
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.620
We can also take the loading boolean

169
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.490
and disable this button if we need to.

170
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.743
So we'll say disabled.

171
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.120
And then if anything goes awry,

172
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.570
if we throw one of those errors

173
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.823
we were talking about here,

174
00:08:25.823 --> 00:08:29.093
we could potentially throw the Cheatin error,

175
00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:32.310
or if they've not found a cart item.

176
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.440
So we need to display that to a user somehow,

177
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.970
so we'll just tag a catch onto the end

178
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.970
and then alert the err.message if anything goes awry.

179
00:08:46.858 --> 00:08:49.410
I think this is gonna work, (laughs)

180
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.760
but it's not actually gonna visually remove it.

181
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.820
That's what we're gonna show you how to do

182
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.810
in the next video.

183
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.023
Let's click on this one; click.

184
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.140
Received a status code of 400.

185
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.590
Okay, so bit of an error.

186
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.083
Let's double-check our backend here.

187
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.730
Variable ID, required type of ID was not provided.

188
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.250
Oh, I see what we did; we forgot to actually

189
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.820
pass the ID along with the mutation.

190
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.820
So two ways we could pass the ID.

191
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.971
We could either pass it to the removeFromCart,

192
00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:21.677
so we could go in here.

193
00:09:21.677 --> 00:09:23.730
We could say the variables are going to be

194
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.420
this.props.id, or in the way I prefer to do it,

195
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.390
let me back that up, is just pass it

196
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.320
right in the mutation.

197
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.313
Variables is equal to ID, this.props.id.

198
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.170
That broke again because this should be

199
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.690
an object literal, so pop another set of

200
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.003
curly brackets around.

201
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.810
Should be in good shape.

202
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.833
Let's delete it.

203
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.760
So I think it worked.

204
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.883
If I refresh now, that should be gone.

205
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.953
Gone.

206
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.453
Why doesn't it remove?

207
00:10:05.453 --> 00:10:09.240
First of all, we aren't doing the re-fetch of

208
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.450
the user's cart, which is what we did

209
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.687
in the AddToCart.

210
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:15.903
Where did we do?

211
00:10:15.903 --> 00:10:17.660
Re-fetch queries, fetching.

212
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.780
But you'll notice that there's a bit of

213
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.023
an issue where if I click on this,

214
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.500
there's a split second where it goes to

215
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.810
the backend and comes back,

216
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.962
and I'm on a fairly fast connection.

217
00:10:27.962 --> 00:10:31.060
What we're gonna do is we're going to

218
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.190
actually update the cache as soon as this is

219
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.530
successfully deleted from the server.

220
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.450
And then in the background, we can go back

221
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.930
and re-fetch behind the scenes.

222
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.280
Stay tuned and we'll do that in the next video.
