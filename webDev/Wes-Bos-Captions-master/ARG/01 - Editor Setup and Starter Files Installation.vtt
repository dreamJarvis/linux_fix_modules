00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.760
<v ->Hello everybody my name is Wes Bos</v>

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.550
and thank you so much for checking out

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.630
advance react and graphql.

4
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.413
I am so excited to build this application with you.

5
00:00:10.413 --> 00:00:11.810
We are going to be learning a whole bunch.

6
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.380
This is a big course,

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.860
and it's gonna be fun.

8
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.980
Some parts are gonna be hard.

9
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.740
Some parts are gonna be really easy,

10
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.090
but I think if you stick through

11
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.210
the entire course you're really going to learn a lot.

12
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.560
The first couple of videos

13
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.116
I'm just gonna be getting you set up with

14
00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:29.840
I gotta lot of files that we need to get installed.

15
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.170
We need to talk about what happens,

16
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.190
if you need some help with some of the things.

17
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.470
We're gonna talk about the front end

18
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.900
and the back end, and any common issues you might run into.

19
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.330
Then the second video we're gonna talk

20
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.890
about some of the tech that we are going to be building.

21
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.453
There's a lot of buzzwords going on.

22
00:00:45.453 --> 00:00:46.920
Then we're gonna dive right in

23
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.380
to actually writing some codes.

24
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.900
So first things first,

25
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.610
you need to sign into your dash board at courses.wesbos.com,

26
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.870
and since I don't have this one up yet

27
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.860
I'm just gonna use my other react course as an example,

28
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.620
but this is something you should see right here.

29
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.160
You'll see advance react and graphql,

30
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.590
and allow you to download the videos for offline view.

31
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.423
You can stream it.

32
00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:10.790
You can access the slack channel,

33
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.920
so if you have any questions about what's going on,

34
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.800
or maybe sometimes you wanna team up

35
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.340
with some people that are taking the course

36
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.900
at the exact same time as you,

37
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.320
you jump into the slack channel and chit-chat there.

38
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.550
What's really important here is

39
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.345
the starter files and the FAQ,

40
00:01:24.345 --> 00:01:26.590
so if you click through to the starter files

41
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.340
you're going to see github repo full of files

42
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.090
that is going to allow us to get up and running.

43
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.220
So this advance react course has kinda three folders here.

44
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.046
First we have the finish application.

45
00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:42.510
This is going to have the front end and the back end

46
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.020
of the finished app that we're working with.

47
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.210
In case you ever need to jump to that.

48
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.130
We're going to have stepped solutions,

49
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.940
so for not every single video,

50
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.720
but for a lot of the videos were there's

51
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.320
significant changes I'll have a folder.

52
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.880
Let me show you in the react one right here.

53
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.130
Stepped solutions.

54
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.880
You're going to see that, like video five,

55
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.070
if you wanna like get caught up to exactly how I have it,

56
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.430
at the start of video five.

57
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.776
Then you would grab the code from the 05 folder,

58
00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:13.700
and paste it into and overtop of what you're working on,

59
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.820
and then or you can just like reference kinda like

60
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.440
maybe in this case you're having trouble

61
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.040
at the store picker, you can go in and see the code

62
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.810
that I've written and just pick and choose the pieces

63
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.810
that you want in order to get yourself up and running.

64
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.900
So again these numbers correspond with the start

65
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.970
of every video, not the end of the video,

66
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.540
so if you wanted, lets see right here,

67
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.366
12 and 13, if you wanted the code for the end of video 12,

68
00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:42.270
you would grab the video files for 13.

69
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.230
Also in the read me are common issues that you run into,

70
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.252
so every now and then you get little errors with npm

71
00:02:50.252 --> 00:02:53.746
or some syntax highlighting stuff.

72
00:02:53.746 --> 00:02:55.102
There's always a couple issues

73
00:02:55.102 --> 00:02:57.840
a bunch of people tend to have,

74
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.210
and I'll definitely update the videos,

75
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.780
if it's something that you run into,

76
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.640
but if it's just a silly little error

77
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.080
or a common error that people are running into

78
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.320
I will always pop those into the read me,

79
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.543
so if you're having trouble,

80
00:03:09.543 --> 00:03:11.640
before you even jump in the slack room,

81
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.299
do a quick scan of the frequently asked questions

82
00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.300
in the read me of the advanced react course.

83
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.630
There's nothing there yet

84
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.400
'cause it hasn't been released as a recording list,

85
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.220
but they will all be in here.

86
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.830
Next up the editor.

87
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.010
Any time I do a course I get lots of email about

88
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.980
what is the extensions that you use?

89
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.920
What is the eslint rules that you use?

90
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.300
What is the editor that you use?

91
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.530
So I am using visual studio code

92
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.340
for my editor in this course.

93
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.780
If you have any questions about anything that I'm using,

94
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.400
you can check out wesbos.com/uses

95
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.810
and there should be answers to all of the questions

96
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.860
about what terminal I use.

97
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.500
What extensions that I use.

98
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.500
Again if you go to github.com/wesbos/dotfiles

99
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.580
D O T F I L E S

100
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.760
I do have the eslint rules that

101
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.460
I specifically use in my own,

102
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.440
and if you're curious about some of the nice formatting

103
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.320
stuff that I use, that will be available.

104
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.060
In this advanced react github repo

105
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.370
there is going to be a folder called sick fits,

106
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.850
and this is the starter files

107
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.800
for what we're gonna be working on.

108
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.090
It may seem like there are a lot of files here,

109
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.430
but this is mostly boiler plate

110
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.430
that comes with a lot of the prisma, yoga, apollo starters,

111
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.180
and we will be going through each of the files

112
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.690
that are in here and explaining what's going on here.

113
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.370
So again don't get too, don't sweat it too much,

114
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.640
that there are some starter files in here.

115
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.870
We'll be reviewing what is in all of that,

116
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.100
and any of the significant logic,

117
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.010
any of the layout

118
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.710
any of the server side rendering stuff.

119
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.890
That's all very important.

120
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.367
We're gonna be writing all of that code ourselves,

121
00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:53.260
so what I want you to do is to go ahead

122
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.305
and either clone this locally,

123
00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:59.350
or go ahead and just download a zip file.

124
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.940
I'm gonna go ahead and clone this to my computer,

125
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.883
so git clone,

126
00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:05.110
and again you don't need to know git to do this,

127
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.120
but it's likely that you already do,

128
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.028
and we'll move into that advance react folder,

129
00:05:09.028 --> 00:05:12.380
and then we want to go into the sick fits folder.

130
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.040
Again all of the code that we're writing

131
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.480
in this course will be done inside of the sick fits folder,

132
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.530
and then inside of that you're gonna see

133
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.550
that we have two folders

134
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.320
because this is a full stack course,

135
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.070
and we're gonna be writing both the code

136
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.753
that runs on the back end of this thing,

137
00:05:27.753 --> 00:05:30.555
and the code that runs on the front end of this thing.

138
00:05:30.555 --> 00:05:31.860
I don't know about you,

139
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.870
but I can sometimes get a little bit confused

140
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.000
as to what sorta code I'm writing,

141
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.470
so what I like to do is both.

142
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.210
We're gonna be hosting them separately

143
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.160
and deploying them separately,

144
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.400
so we wanna put them in separate folders,

145
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.042
but I like to have them open in two different editors,

146
00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:49.881
so I know exactly what's going on in each one.

147
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:53.490
So I'm gonna go into the front end folder first,

148
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.610
and I'm going to open that up in my editor,

149
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.170
and if you're using vs code along with me

150
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.400
you'll notice that I have a vs code folder in here,

151
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.750
and you're gonna see a settings.jason file,

152
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.990
and this is actually setting the color of this top bar

153
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.090
to be yellow, so that means when we're working

154
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.652
on the front end my editor is going to be yellow.

155
00:06:13.652 --> 00:06:16.610
Similarly, if I go back into my back end folder

156
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.530
and open that up, you're gonna see that the back end

157
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.230
is always in pink, so just a nice little way

158
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.740
to differentiate between the back end pink,

159
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.675
the front end yellow,

160
00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:28.952
and I will always have two separate code editors open,

161
00:06:28.952 --> 00:06:31.850
and we'll be able to jump back and forth through them.

162
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.917
If you did notice when you open it up

163
00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:34.820
and you don't see the specific colors,

164
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.130
you do need to turn on one setting in vs code.

165
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.380
If you hit command comma,

166
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.445
I think that's a control camp comma,

167
00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:44.238
or just go up to your regular visual studio code preferences

168
00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:46.623
and search for title.

169
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.850
There's gonna be a setting here that says title bar style.

170
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.530
We wanna set that to custom,

171
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.330
and then it's gonna ask you to restart your application.

172
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.560
It should start to see the color show up,

173
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.980
so again make sure you have that setting

174
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.985
of custom turned on.

175
00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:06.270
I also recommend that you always have two tabs open

176
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.422
in your editor, I'm using hyper term here.

177
00:07:08.422 --> 00:07:12.860
Again, go to wesbos.com/uses for everything

178
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.780
that I'm using in here.

179
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.060
It's not important that you use vs code

180
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.020
or any of these tools.

181
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.380
You can use any text editor that you're comfortable with,

182
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.640
but, however, I know a lot of you are using vs code

183
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.180
and this nice little differentiation that we have here,

184
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.120
so I'm going to keep the back end open in one of my tabs,

185
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.950
and then I'm also going to go into the front end.

186
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.790
Sick fits, front end,

187
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.830
and now we're gonna have a back end tab and front in tab,

188
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.480
and what I want you to do is go ahead and type

189
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.413
npm install into both,

190
00:07:50.555 --> 00:07:52.720
and that's gonna run off and grab all the dependencies.

191
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.840
We're gonna review what all the dependencies are

192
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.019
in coming videos, so don't worry about too much

193
00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:58.850
about what they are just yet.

194
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.981
Just know that we're trying to npm install each of them.

195
00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:05.830
Also stick with the versions that I have posted to github.

196
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.097
I will periodically be updating those versions

197
00:08:08.097 --> 00:08:10.077
to the newest versions, however,

198
00:08:10.077 --> 00:08:13.040
sometimes what happens is a version

199
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.710
of the library will come out,

200
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.161
and they'll have a bit of a breaking change,

201
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:19.380
and before I can update the video,

202
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.480
if there's a breaking change,

203
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.400
then you're gonna have a bad time in the tutorial.

204
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.724
So stick with the versions that are on github,

205
00:08:24.724 --> 00:08:29.220
and then as there are any updates to the videos,

206
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.580
I will be updating the videos

207
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.680
and noting any changes that have changed

208
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.318
since I have changed the videos.

209
00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:42.318
Other than that, I think we are ready to go.

210
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.480
We've got our folders.

211
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.420
We've got our colors.

212
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.360
We, you can run npm run dev on both of these,

213
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.739
but don't do that just yet

214
00:08:48.739 --> 00:08:50.870
because we have to write a little bit of code

215
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.260
before that's going to work.

216
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.130
So that's it for this video.

217
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.510
In the next video we're gonna be talking about

218
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.880
some of the high level program concepts.

219
00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.953
Some of the different packages that we're going to be using.

220
00:08:59.953 --> 00:09:01.460
As well as taking a look

221
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.223
at the actual application that we'll be building.
