00:00:01.227 --> 00:00:03.829
<v ->In this video we are going to be doing</v>

2
00:00:03.829 --> 00:00:06.011
some of the styling so we can go from this

3
00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:09.370
to something a little bit closer to how this looks,

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.141
and we're gonna be using style components

5
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:12.931
obviously to do that.

6
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:15.011
Before we get into that, let me talk real quick

7
00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:17.600
about how to organize your style components.

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.341
There's a couple different ways that you can do it.

9
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:22.440
First, and the most basic, is you can just

10
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.299
put the style component in the same file

11
00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:28.048
as the component that you're styling.

12
00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:30.661
That works well when the only thing

13
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:32.709
that you're using that style component for

14
00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:34.891
is the thing that's also in that file.

15
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:37.541
However, there is many cases where you

16
00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:40.120
want to reuse a style component because

17
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.629
maybe it's a specific button,

18
00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.251
maybe it's a list of things, maybe it's this item...

19
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:47.221
And if that's the case then you probably wanna put

20
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.237
it in a separate file and export it from that file

21
00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:53.651
so that you can reuse it throughout your application.

22
00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:56.069
So what I usually like to do is just write

23
00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.747
the style component directly inside of the same component.

24
00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:01.821
Like if I was styling this page,

25
00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:04.821
I would write it directly inside of Page.js

26
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:06.659
and then if I found oh,

27
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.531
I actually need that for something else

28
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:14.061
then what I'll do is I'll ex refactor it and export it

29
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.688
into it's own file so that I can import it

30
00:01:16.688 --> 00:01:19.048
and reuse it in this page as well as maybe

31
00:01:19.048 --> 00:01:21.791
some of the other components that I may have.

32
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:23.941
I find that that's easiest for authoring where

33
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:28.582
if I'm working on both like the markup as well as the CSS

34
00:01:28.582 --> 00:01:31.123
then I can just be working in one single file

35
00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.102
and then kick it off to a separate file

36
00:01:33.102 --> 00:01:35.423
when I need to reuse it.

37
00:01:35.423 --> 00:01:38.684
Other options are you can go in your components folder

38
00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:42.151
and I like to have a styled, a styles folder

39
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:44.194
and I put all of my styled components in there.

40
00:01:44.194 --> 00:01:46.874
So we've got a close button, where you import style

41
00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:49.674
components, you make your button, and then you export it.

42
00:01:49.674 --> 00:01:53.333
You have a form button, here's some key frames in here

43
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.834
and we'll take a look at that in just a little bit

44
00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:57.871
once we get into loading states.

45
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:00.084
And you see that I've put everything into here

46
00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:02.263
and any time I need to use this specific form

47
00:02:02.263 --> 00:02:05.031
on the website, I just need to import the form

48
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:08.434
style components and just go ahead and use it.

49
00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:11.034
Some other people like to maybe, if I show you here,

50
00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:14.114
they like to have folders for each specific one.

51
00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:16.714
So it may be in your components folder,

52
00:02:16.714 --> 00:02:19.965
you have a header folder, and then inside of that

53
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.993
you'll have an index.js, which will contain

54
00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:23.954
the actual component itself.

55
00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:25.733
And then maybe you'll have a styles.js,

56
00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:28.965
which will contain all the styles for the header.

57
00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:32.465
And then maybe you'll have like a test.js,

58
00:02:34.165 --> 00:02:35.893
that will include all of the tests

59
00:02:35.893 --> 00:02:37.852
for that specific component, and then anything else

60
00:02:37.852 --> 00:02:39.623
that's related to this header component

61
00:02:39.623 --> 00:02:42.442
can sort of live in its own directory.

62
00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:45.234
That's a fairly good option once you get into

63
00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:49.293
applications that have dozens and dozens of components

64
00:02:49.293 --> 00:02:53.343
However I find it gets a little bit confusing

65
00:02:53.343 --> 00:02:55.583
for especially when you're doing a tutorial,

66
00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:57.324
it gets a little bit confusing when you have

67
00:02:57.324 --> 00:03:01.074
30 index.js files in your actual application.

68
00:03:02.124 --> 00:03:06.021
So I am going the route where I call it what it is

69
00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:08.354
inside of the components folder

70
00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.645
and then if I have a reusable style I will

71
00:03:10.645 --> 00:03:12.391
stick it in the styles folder

72
00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:15.943
that is exported from there, I can import it as we go.

73
00:03:15.943 --> 00:03:18.063
So take a look at some of the different options

74
00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:20.463
for managing your style components.

75
00:03:20.463 --> 00:03:23.245
Again, chat with your team to see what is best for you.

76
00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:25.794
Now let's go into this page.js here

77
00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:28.333
and first thing I wanna do is replace this div here

78
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.573
with a sort of a styled page so

79
00:03:30.573 --> 00:03:34.085
we're gonna import styled from styled components,

80
00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:35.844
and we're gonna make a styled page.

81
00:03:35.844 --> 00:03:39.761
So say const styled page is equal to styled.div

82
00:03:41.978 --> 00:03:44.929
and the inside of that we can say background is black,

83
00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:48.540
and no background is white and the

84
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.410
color is going to be black.

85
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.578
We're gonna come back and swap out that black color

86
00:03:53.578 --> 00:03:55.570
with a theme value, but for now we're gonna

87
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.980
hard code it as black.

88
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.980
Then all we need to do is swap this out with the styled page

89
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.410
and everything should look exactly how we have it.

90
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.900
Now what we wanna do is in here,

91
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.690
if I have like a really wide website,

92
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.570
I don't want the items to go all the way.

93
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.820
I do want the header and the search to go all the way across

94
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.791
but everything else inside of that page I want

95
00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:21.922
it to be constrained to I don't know,

96
00:04:21.922 --> 00:04:24.618
a thousand pixels, 1200 pixels wide.

97
00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:27.860
So what we'll do it we'll make an inner component const.

98
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.027
Inner is equal to styled.div, and we'll just put a

99
00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:37.548
max width of 1000px or so on it.

100
00:04:41.122 --> 00:04:45.455
And we'll say margin zero auto, and padding two rem.

101
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:48.790
And we'll come back to that, how that rem is sized

102
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.612
with global styling in the next video.

103
00:04:51.612 --> 00:04:54.132
Then we just take our inner component that we have

104
00:04:54.132 --> 00:04:57.308
put the this.props.children inside of it,

105
00:04:57.308 --> 00:05:02.172
and there we go, you can see that it's not being sized

106
00:05:02.172 --> 00:05:04.702
or it is now being sized and we can test it by

107
00:05:04.702 --> 00:05:08.772
saying background red, and you'll see that this thing

108
00:05:08.772 --> 00:05:13.302
is now centered and constraining its own width.

109
00:05:13.302 --> 00:05:15.228
Good, so we have our styled page,

110
00:05:15.228 --> 00:05:17.171
we have our inner component.

111
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:18.822
Next thing that we need to do is to actually

112
00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:22.989
not hard code these values of 1000px and of black.

113
00:05:24.332 --> 00:05:26.710
We actually wanna stick those values into a theme

114
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.121
so if you are coming from sass or something like that,

115
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.812
you'll know that you can, you can just have like

116
00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:35.361
a variables file or at the top of your sass file

117
00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:37.982
you can declare what all your variables are

118
00:05:37.982 --> 00:05:40.041
and then anywhere below that and

119
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:43.062
anywhere in any of your other files,

120
00:05:43.062 --> 00:05:44.880
you can just use those variables

121
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.790
and that's really handy if you have specific colors or

122
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.908
sizes or fonts or anything that you want to reuse

123
00:05:50.908 --> 00:05:53.630
through your application, and also if you wanna

124
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.812
just change a specific black color,

125
00:05:55.812 --> 00:05:58.102
you don't have to do a huge find and replace on

126
00:05:58.102 --> 00:06:02.342
your application, you just need to change it in your theme.

127
00:06:02.342 --> 00:06:05.212
So styled components has this concept of themes

128
00:06:05.212 --> 00:06:06.782
and your themes are simply just an

129
00:06:06.782 --> 00:06:09.070
object full of property values that

130
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.400
you wish to reuse throughout your application.

131
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.750
So just say const theme is equal to an object

132
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.612
and I'm going to just paste them in here.

133
00:06:17.612 --> 00:06:20.241
If you wanna grab them yourself either pause the video

134
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:22.622
and type them in or hit the finished files

135
00:06:22.622 --> 00:06:26.150
and grab page.js for the theme value.

136
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.451
What do we got here? We got our specific

137
00:06:27.451 --> 00:06:30.910
reds, blacks, grays, we got our max width,

138
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.892
and a bs which is a box shadow that I like to reuse

139
00:06:33.892 --> 00:06:35.481
fairly often in it.

140
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:38.942
And the only thing that you really need to know here

141
00:06:38.942 --> 00:06:41.742
is that these are strings because this is not CSS

142
00:06:41.742 --> 00:06:43.281
like a styled component is,

143
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:46.051
these are, this is an object that needs to

144
00:06:46.051 --> 00:06:48.241
have quotes around each of them.

145
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.740
I do it myself all the time and accidentally

146
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.676
I just space out and forget to put the quotes around it.

147
00:06:53.676 --> 00:06:57.022
And then your application starts to break.

148
00:06:57.022 --> 00:06:58.692
So what we wanna do with this theme now

149
00:06:58.692 --> 00:07:00.670
is to go into our styled components and

150
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.841
we wanna import two new things.

151
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:04.742
As well as we wanna import styled,

152
00:07:04.742 --> 00:07:07.659
we wanna import the theme provider,

153
00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:12.942
and we also want to import something called inject global,

154
00:07:12.942 --> 00:07:14.750
and we're gonna learn about that in the next video.

155
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.670
Let's just import it while we're there.

156
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.961
Then we wanna go down to the styled page

157
00:07:18.961 --> 00:07:23.961
and just wrap the entire application in the theme provider

158
00:07:24.326 --> 00:07:25.612
and this is actually pretty neat,

159
00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:28.411
it's using something called a react context api

160
00:07:28.411 --> 00:07:30.862
and if you've never heard of the react context api,

161
00:07:30.862 --> 00:07:34.510
I've gotta-- react context, if you take a quick look

162
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.927
at Google videos, there we go

163
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.948
I'm the first and the second video

164
00:07:39.948 --> 00:07:41.929
if you search for react context

165
00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:44.876
Little 10, 15 minute video showing you how

166
00:07:44.876 --> 00:07:47.451
react context works but at a high level what it does

167
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:51.034
is it allows you to specify values up high,

168
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.150
like our theme and then any child maybe at six

169
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.942
or seven levels deep can then access those values

170
00:07:57.942 --> 00:08:02.062
without having to pass down the values from

171
00:08:02.062 --> 00:08:05.382
component to component, it's via context.

172
00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:07.732
And that's great if you've ever been what's called

173
00:08:07.732 --> 00:08:09.940
prop drilling where you have to pass down values

174
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.350
and it gets to be a little bit hairy.

175
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.600
So we're going to take the theme provider component

176
00:08:18.638 --> 00:08:21.582
and wrap the entire application in that,

177
00:08:21.582 --> 00:08:24.252
and then the theme provider expects you

178
00:08:24.252 --> 00:08:26.870
to pass at a theme object, which is just a

179
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.252
regular old object of property values that we

180
00:08:29.252 --> 00:08:31.158
have to find right here.

181
00:08:31.158 --> 00:08:34.022
So if we give that a save now, refresh the page,

182
00:08:34.022 --> 00:08:36.622
everything's looking good now what we can try to do

183
00:08:36.622 --> 00:08:40.430
to use it is let's replace this max width right here

184
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.190
we use interpolation, which is

185
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.081
a dollar sign curly brackets.

186
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:46.782
Remember we're just in back text here

187
00:08:46.782 --> 00:08:48.280
which is template literals

188
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.470
and we can give it a little arrow function

189
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.222
which we have props and then you could always

190
00:08:53.222 --> 00:08:56.692
access your theme on props.theme.

191
00:08:56.692 --> 00:08:59.582
And then anything that is inside of

192
00:08:59.582 --> 00:09:04.249
this theme object, in our case it's the max width value.

193
00:09:07.622 --> 00:09:09.390
Let's just try it once more,

194
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.057
if we were to do background props.theme.red,

195
00:09:15.518 --> 00:09:18.660
you can see that that specific red is being pulled in

196
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.990
whenever I save it so that's how you do it

197
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.812
and that's kinda cool because you could have like

198
00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.852
a dark theme or a light theme

199
00:09:24.852 --> 00:09:26.862
and then depending on a setting

200
00:09:26.862 --> 00:09:28.782
that the user has in the browser,

201
00:09:28.782 --> 00:09:31.441
you could pass in a different object for each one

202
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:34.468
and totally change how the thing looks

203
00:09:34.468 --> 00:09:38.302
without messing with classes or anything like that.

204
00:09:38.302 --> 00:09:39.950
I think that's pretty neat.

205
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.836
So I'll remove this background here.

206
00:09:41.836 --> 00:09:44.670
I also want to swap out this color here

207
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.078
from black to the specific black that I like to use,

208
00:09:48.078 --> 00:09:51.422
the 393939, so I'll use dollar sign curly bracket

209
00:09:51.422 --> 00:09:55.339
we have props, then we return props.theme.black

210
00:09:58.689 --> 00:10:00.142
and you can hardly tell but if you were to

211
00:10:00.142 --> 00:10:01.710
inspect one of these suckers here

212
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.068
you should see that we are using 393939

213
00:10:05.068 --> 00:10:07.430
instead of regular black.

214
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.166
So that is our theme provider,

215
00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:10.252
that's a couple components,

216
00:10:10.252 --> 00:10:11.960
I'm leaving these in this file because

217
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.601
I don't need to reuse them anywhere else.

218
00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:15.822
If that bugs you, then you can put them

219
00:10:15.822 --> 00:10:18.532
in your own files, export them from that file,

220
00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:20.281
import them into here and then

221
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:22.281
use them just as we have here.

222
00:10:22.281 --> 00:10:24.022
Now next up what we wanna do is

223
00:10:24.022 --> 00:10:28.398
to style our header.js so actually I don't need form open,

224
00:10:28.398 --> 00:10:29.430
I don't need medit open,

225
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.110
let's just open header.js and you see

226
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.142
that we have all these like empty divs here,

227
00:10:34.142 --> 00:10:37.652
we're gonna swap those out with a couple styled components

228
00:10:37.652 --> 00:10:41.069
so things will start to look pretty nice.

229
00:10:42.092 --> 00:10:43.881
First thing I wanna do is let's wrap this

230
00:10:43.881 --> 00:10:47.964
sick fits in an h1 tag and put that inside of it.

231
00:10:49.652 --> 00:10:51.420
And you know the other thing that we need to do is

232
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.622
if we wanna link this back to the home page,

233
00:10:53.622 --> 00:10:58.081
we actually need to wrap it in a next.js link component.

234
00:10:58.081 --> 00:11:02.249
Let's import the link component from next link

235
00:11:02.249 --> 00:11:06.372
and then we will just simply take the link component,

236
00:11:06.372 --> 00:11:08.401
put the anchor link inside of it,

237
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:10.630
and then we have to take the href

238
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.780
out of there and into this one.

239
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.052
So if I give it a-- oh the href's gotta go to

240
00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:19.062
forward slash which is the home page.

241
00:11:19.062 --> 00:11:21.028
So if I'm on the sell page, I should be able to click

242
00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:23.542
there we go, brings me back to the home page.

243
00:11:23.542 --> 00:11:26.750
Good, now let's work on styling this logo here.

244
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.572
Instead of an h1 tag, I actually want it

245
00:11:28.572 --> 00:11:30.452
to be a logo component and that's what

246
00:11:30.452 --> 00:11:31.480
we're gonna do up here.

247
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.051
Oh, we need to import styled components first so

248
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:38.630
import styled from styled components and then const the logo

249
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.411
is equal to styled.h1 and let's just go ahead

250
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:46.244
and start styling it so font size is four rem,

251
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.390
the margin left is two rem,

252
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.972
by the way I'm using Emmet here in JSX.

253
00:11:51.972 --> 00:11:55.441
And if you're curious about how to get Emmet to work

254
00:11:55.441 --> 00:11:56.774
inside of JSX...

255
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.310
Emmet.includelanguages,

256
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.262
javascript is set as javascript react

257
00:12:06.262 --> 00:12:09.622
and that will allow you to use Emmet both for CSS

258
00:12:09.622 --> 00:12:13.039
as well as HTML inside of your .js files.

259
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.870
So we've got here margin left two rem,

260
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.453
position relative, z index two,

261
00:12:21.268 --> 00:12:24.435
transform skew negative seven degrees.

262
00:12:32.238 --> 00:12:35.241
We'll see how we're doing here.

263
00:12:35.241 --> 00:12:37.030
Oh, obviously you don't see any changes

264
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.070
cause we need to take this logo component and

265
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.062
swap it out with this h1 so now it's just a logo component

266
00:12:42.062 --> 00:12:43.921
and now it starts to look good.

267
00:12:43.921 --> 00:12:46.590
We haven't done any fonts or any base styling just yet

268
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.262
because those are gonna be global styles

269
00:12:48.262 --> 00:12:50.721
that we are hitting in the next video.

270
00:12:50.721 --> 00:12:52.852
However, inside of this logo now we need to

271
00:12:52.852 --> 00:12:56.612
just style the link tag, so we'll select the a,

272
00:12:56.612 --> 00:12:59.310
and see what I mean about just being able to select a

273
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.030
and you don't have to worry about it being any a on the page

274
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.422
you know that it's just the anchor link inside of this

275
00:13:05.422 --> 00:13:07.755
h1 so padding 0.5 rem 1 rem,

276
00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:16.508
background is going to be, I have this tp snippet

277
00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:18.969
that I've given myself so all I have to do is

278
00:13:18.969 --> 00:13:22.051
type colon tp and then it will give me

279
00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:25.134
props props.theme.red, color is white

280
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.107
text transform uppercase, text decoration none,

281
00:13:35.761 --> 00:13:39.011
And okay, and what I also want to do is

282
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.030
just on this h1 in general,

283
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.401
I wanna say when we hit less than 1300 pixels,

284
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:48.588
I wanna center it and the way that you can do media queries

285
00:13:48.588 --> 00:13:52.001
inside of a styled component is you simply just write

286
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:54.678
the media query where you want it to apply,

287
00:13:54.678 --> 00:13:57.622
and then it will apply to that once you hit it.

288
00:13:57.622 --> 00:14:01.372
So we just say at media, max width at 1300px.

289
00:14:02.689 --> 00:14:04.689
I wanna get margin zero,

290
00:14:06.628 --> 00:14:09.461
and I wanna say text align center.

291
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.113
And there we go.

292
00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.270
Doo doo doo, back and forth back and forth,

293
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.561
you see how those media queries are kicking in.

294
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:22.268
You just have to put the media queries inside

295
00:14:22.268 --> 00:14:24.990
of the actual selector itself.

296
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.860
If I only wanted that to apply to the link,

297
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.211
I could put a media query inside of the link here or

298
00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:35.950
I could write a selector inside of the media query as well.

299
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.812
Depends on how you wanna approach it,

300
00:14:37.812 --> 00:14:40.441
both will work just fine.

301
00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:41.670
So that's looking good to me,

302
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.628
obviously fonts aren't just yet.

303
00:14:43.628 --> 00:14:46.172
Now we wanna work on the layout of the navigation,

304
00:14:46.172 --> 00:14:48.150
and that is this div right here.

305
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.852
So what we're gonna do is make another component

306
00:14:50.852 --> 00:14:54.742
called styled header so const styled header

307
00:14:54.742 --> 00:14:56.825
is equal to styled.header

308
00:15:00.502 --> 00:15:03.790
and let's just go ahead and swap out this div immediately

309
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.572
with the styled header

310
00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:08.022
and at this point I'm just gonna write all of the CSS.

311
00:15:08.022 --> 00:15:10.278
I'll talk through it so if you are curious about

312
00:15:10.278 --> 00:15:14.142
the layout and the grid and the styling of the header,

313
00:15:14.142 --> 00:15:16.390
you can stick with me, otherwise feel free

314
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.532
to just copy this from the answer

315
00:15:18.532 --> 00:15:21.532
and I'll see you in the next video.

316
00:15:21.532 --> 00:15:23.320
There's nothing else significant that I'm doing

317
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.121
in the rest of this video other than styling.

318
00:15:25.121 --> 00:15:27.538
So either bye or let's do it.

319
00:15:28.662 --> 00:15:31.782
So first thing I'm gonna do is select the bar selector

320
00:15:31.782 --> 00:15:35.452
and we wanna border bottom 10px solid

321
00:15:35.452 --> 00:15:38.952
and then I wanna use my theme props black.

322
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:43.998
Ooh yeah, looking good.

323
00:15:45.401 --> 00:15:48.190
Wanna display grid on this sucker.

324
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.023
Grid template columns.

325
00:15:53.772 --> 00:15:57.189
Auto 1fr. Justify content, space between.

326
00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:02.262
This will all make sense once we start getting

327
00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:04.902
elements in our actual navigation.

328
00:16:04.902 --> 00:16:06.819
And align items stretch

329
00:16:13.782 --> 00:16:16.449
and we wanna put a media 1300px.

330
00:16:21.388 --> 00:16:24.270
And since we've used this 1300px twice now,

331
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.190
you could probably also put that in your theme,

332
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.692
and then just have it as a reusable break point

333
00:16:29.692 --> 00:16:31.892
which would be kinda cool.

334
00:16:31.892 --> 00:16:35.110
And then when we hit that, I just wanna

335
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:40.110
bring everything down to 1fr. So not two columns, just one

336
00:16:40.377 --> 00:16:43.377
and we wanna justify content center.

337
00:16:47.017 --> 00:16:49.828
Looking good, now I also wanna grab the sub bar.

338
00:16:49.828 --> 00:16:53.297
Sub bar, that is here. We've got the bar

339
00:16:53.297 --> 00:16:55.927
which has the logo and the nav inside of it.

340
00:16:55.927 --> 00:16:58.868
And then the secondary sub bar we'll have our search

341
00:16:58.868 --> 00:17:01.759
as well as, actually just the search.

342
00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:04.217
Let's take a look at it right now.

343
00:17:04.217 --> 00:17:07.649
This is our main bar here, the nav in it.

344
00:17:07.649 --> 00:17:11.107
And then our secondary bar is just the search inside of here

345
00:17:11.107 --> 00:17:13.759
and then we have a third which is the cart

346
00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:15.769
that is gonna pop out from the side but we'll

347
00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:17.999
cross that bridge once we come to it.

348
00:17:17.999 --> 00:17:22.318
So then we'll go back up here and style the sub bar.

349
00:17:22.318 --> 00:17:24.568
Display grid on that thing,

350
00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:30.755
grid template columns is 1fr and atuo.

351
00:17:34.129 --> 00:17:36.046
Border bottom px solid.

352
00:17:39.678 --> 00:17:43.588
And I'm going to use my snippet there again, theme props.

353
00:17:43.588 --> 00:17:45.921
It's going to be light gray.

354
00:17:47.929 --> 00:17:50.929
And let's take a quick look, whoops.

355
00:17:52.148 --> 00:17:55.679
Oh, not 10px, one px, and it's looking good.

356
00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:58.857
By the way, I realize that I didn't capital case that

357
00:17:58.857 --> 00:18:02.940
in my theme, so here it should be capital G gray,

358
00:18:03.937 --> 00:18:07.345
but because I have used it as a lowercase g

359
00:18:07.345 --> 00:18:09.777
in some of my other components, I'm going to leave it as is.

360
00:18:09.777 --> 00:18:11.108
If you really wanted to do it,

361
00:18:11.108 --> 00:18:13.777
you could just say theme.lightgrey

362
00:18:13.777 --> 00:18:16.110
is equal to theme.lightgrey.

363
00:18:17.508 --> 00:18:21.249
That would just fix it but not too worried about it.

364
00:18:21.249 --> 00:18:23.215
Just know that there's no capital g on the

365
00:18:23.215 --> 00:18:25.399
gray that we have there.

366
00:18:25.399 --> 00:18:28.257
So this is looking a little bit better.

367
00:18:28.257 --> 00:18:30.548
In the next video we are going to cover both

368
00:18:30.548 --> 00:18:34.249
typography as well as some of the global styles.

369
00:18:34.249 --> 00:18:35.889
Because obviously we have like this base,

370
00:18:35.889 --> 00:18:38.468
there's no reset that we've done in here.

371
00:18:38.468 --> 00:18:41.049
We've got some margin and padding that's going on here,

372
00:18:41.049 --> 00:18:42.849
we've got this ugly Times New Roman.

373
00:18:42.849 --> 00:18:45.129
We need to get away from all of that

374
00:18:45.129 --> 00:18:46.839
and apply it to the entire page

375
00:18:46.839 --> 00:18:48.388
so we'll see you in that video.
