(upbeat music)

2
00:00:03.131 --> 00:00:04.650
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.220
<v Instructor>So a quick note on accessibility,</v>

4
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.540
and keeping our websites accessible

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.590
to anybody who wants to use them,

6
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.880
no matter what maybe disability they might have,

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.140
or what input are device they have,

8
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.010
or what situation they're currently in,

9
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.400
it should still be a usable website.

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.991
And HTML by itself, if you mark it up correctly,

11
00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:26.190
And HTML by itself, if you mark it up correctly,

12
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.660
is very accessible.

13
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.150
What happens often is us JavaScript developers come in here

14
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.890
and goof it up for everybody.

15
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.740
And we make these things

16
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.120
that only work with the mouse,

17
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.710
or aren't accessible to anybody.

18
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.870
or aren't accessible to anybody.

19
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.200
So what we want to do here is just go over a couple

20
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.310
of common pitfalls that happen in JavaScript.

21
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.540
Because I think most of these accessibility goof ups are not

22
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.397
because someone is sitting there being,

23
00:00:54.397 --> 00:00:56.330
"Oh, well, screw blind people."

24
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.220
No, they're not saying that at all.

25
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.730
They accidentally, they don't know what they're doing,

26
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.630
they don't know what to look out for,

27
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.750
and then before you know it,

28
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.890
you've deployed a website

29
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.280
that is unintentionally hurting somebody.

30
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.140
So, what we want to do here is

31
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.150
just kind of go over a couple pitfalls,

32
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.755
and the biggest one is,

33
00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:14.588
this bugs me as well,

34
00:01:14.588 --> 00:01:15.980
this bugs me as well,

35
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.940
it bugs everybody,

36
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.710
is that the difference between buttons and links.

37
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.830
So,

38
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.608
buttons are to be used for actions

39
00:01:22.608 --> 00:01:24.496
buttons are to be used for actions

40
00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:27.092
that happen inside of a application.

41
00:01:27.092 --> 00:01:28.130
that happen inside of a application.

42
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.090
Links are used to change the page.

43
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.670
Do not mix those up,

44
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.670
meaning that links are not to be used where buttons are.

45
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.120
And I see this all the time where.

46
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.750
Somebody will go in here and they'll have

47
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.540
like an A, and I've certainly done this myself.

48
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.840
I'm sure you can dig it up,

49
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.240
and they have an a href=#.

50
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.563
They link it and they'll call it like a save button.

51
00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:54.020
They what they'll do is go into JavaScript and select it,

52
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.730
and say when somebody clicks this save button,

53
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.140
prevent the default,

54
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.560
and then go ahead and save whatever it that you're saving in

55
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.200
and that's not a used case for a link,

56
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.890
because a link that doesn't go anywhere is not a link.

57
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.430
That is a used case for a button,

58
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.650
that is an action within your application

59
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.170
or that's an action within your website.

60
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.050
That actually needs to do something.

61
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.420
It's still fine to prevent default on a specific link

62
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.031
like for example on Twitter

63
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:21.960
like for example on Twitter

64
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.350
Here let me open up Twitter.

65
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.483
Wes bos.

66
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.430
And if I try to go to tweets and replies.

67
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.030
You'll see that this is probably a link.

68
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.560
Yeah this is a link and it goes to /wes/ with replies,

69
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.160
but if I click.

70
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.620
It says you're not signed in.

71
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.260
You can't view that just yet.

72
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.219
That's a very valid use case for using a prevent default.

73
00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.310
That's a very valid use case for using a prevent default.

74
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.870
What does is that says if they're not signed in.

75
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.390
Prevent the default of going to that page

76
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.700
and show this little sign in box.

77
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.220
You still can't right click open a new tab

78
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.130
and that will still go to the URL,

79
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.600
but now it's telling you to go ahead and log in.

80
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.820
That's an absolutely valid use case.

81
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.550
Where as something like this.

82
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.550
Where it's a follow button.

83
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.900
That doesn't go to specific page.

84
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.080
So if we inspect it.

85
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.030
There it is,

86
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.863
it is a button.

87
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:17.710
Right so.

88
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.030
Then that will trigger the action of following the person.

89
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.098
So whenever you need to do something.

90
00:03:24.098 --> 00:03:25.475
Don't mix up buttons and links.

91
00:03:25.475 --> 00:03:27.163
Don't mix up buttons and links.

92
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.290
The other thing I want to tell you about is,

93
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.320
Things are not keyboard accessible.

94
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.390
Should not have clicks registered on them,

95
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.820
unless you need to.

96
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.450
So one example is we'll have an image and

97
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.775
https picsum.photos/200 put alt nice.

98
00:03:42.775 --> 00:03:47.120
https picsum.photos/200 put alt nice.

99
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.100
Now we have - this didn't work- .photos,

100
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.430
there we go that's good.

101
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.470
Now we can go ahead and listen for a click on that thing.

102
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.590
Maybe give it a class of a photo...

103
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.190
and I'll go to my JavaScript here.

104
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.500
i'll just use this as forms on here.

105
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.513
Grab a photo.

106
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.530
Then we'll take our photo

107
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.870
and we'll add an event listener,

108
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.110
to click.

109
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.300
to click.

110
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.963
And then we will run a function here.

111
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.860
And console log "You clicked the photo".

112
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.640
So there certainly are valid use cases

113
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.430
for clicking on a photo.

114
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.400
Maybe it will open up a larger version of that photo.

115
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.109
Maybe want to do some drawing on that photo.

116
00:04:32.109 --> 00:04:33.380
Maybe want to do some drawing on that photo.

117
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.850
Maybe you want to zoom it in or

118
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.800
be able to click and drag around.

119
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.670
Certainly lots of valid use cases for clicking on the photo.

120
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.000
Which is great

121
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.120
and if I open up my DevTools here if I click it.

122
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.600
It says you clicked on the photo.

123
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.893
However if I throw my mouse away and try do this

124
00:04:50.893 --> 00:04:53.940
However if I throw my mouse away and try do this with just-

125
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.907
get out of here wes.

126
00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:56.574
get out of here wes.

127
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.400
Did you see that dog in the blanket?

128
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.530
We messed it.

129
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.873
Anyways if I try to click on that photo now.

130
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.700
I can tab through all of my everything on browser here,

131
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.570
but I can't click on that photo with only my keyboard.

132
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.950
And that's a bit of a problem

133
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.970
because if the user doesn't have a mouse or

134
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.720
they're unable to use a mouse

135
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.040
then they can't use that part of your website.

136
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.940
So super easy solution is you can either change it,

137
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.380
you can give your thing a role of button.

138
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.320
If you mean for something to be

139
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.740
a button that is not a button tag like.

140
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.700
I don't know why,

141
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.000
but for some reason people use divs as buttons

142
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.840
and if you really need to-

143
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.830
you have a valid reason for doing that,

144
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.020
you must go ahead and add a role of button to that div.

145
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.210
Then you also need to give it a tabindex,

146
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.600
Then you also need to give it a tabindex,

147
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.500
likely of zero and what will do is it will put in the flow.

148
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.060
So that people can tab to it with their keyboards.

149
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.690
Same thing with this image here.

150
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.270
You can give it a roll button,

151
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.700
but if you're doing that.

152
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.910
It's probably easier just to use a button

153
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.700
and then put the image inside of the button.

154
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.040
And then you're in better shape right?

155
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.100
So that's another option we have there.

156
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.744
so I'll do this tabindex = zero on this one-

157
00:06:14.744 --> 00:06:17.100
so I'll do this tabindex = zero on this one-

158
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.403
what did I forget here?

159
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.500
Now when I go through my tabbing.

160
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.770
You'll see that I can focus each of those things.

161
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.340
That I have here and kinda go

162
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.850
back and forth between the two.

163
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.960
Now if I focus this image here and hit my enter key.

164
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.930
Unlike some other buttons and things like that.

165
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.480
It still will not trigger a click.

166
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.210
So that's the case you have to go back to your JavaScript

167
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.050
and you also have to also grab this event listener.

168
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.623
What I would do here is say function handle photo click.

169
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.920
And we move with my logic up to an external function

170
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.160
and then just wire it up like this.

171
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.240
Handle photo click

172
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.520
and then I would duplicate that

173
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.635
and listen for a key up event on the photo as well.

174
00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:08.130
and listen for a key up event on the photo as well.

175
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.801
Now when I go to that image.

176
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:12.134
Now when I go to that image.

177
00:07:13.473 --> 00:07:14.529
You can click on over to it.

178
00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:15.780
You can click on over to it.

179
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.020
Now you notice actually right there.

180
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.240
A little aside here,

181
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.780
but when I focus into that.

182
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.380
It says you click the photo and that's not actually true.

183
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.410
I'm only looking for the enter key.

184
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.890
So like there's another little piece of information.

185
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.478
How do I then only listen for the enter key on here?

186
00:07:34.478 --> 00:07:39.420
How do I then only listen for the enter key on here?

187
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.650
The event has a bunch of information about that.

188
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.040
Go to the event,

189
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.741
console log the event and the event has a .key or .key code.

190
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:48.310
console log the event and the event has a .key or .key code.

191
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.880
The .key is more modern and more ideal.

192
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.600
It's supported in most browsers.

193
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.070
In every single key

194
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.920
on an event will give you a bunch of information.

195
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.960
I have this website called Keycode.info

196
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.690
and you can literally just press on any key.

197
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.280
In it and it will give you the

198
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.360
meta information about that key.

199
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.628
So we have a event.key, event.which and event.code.

200
00:08:08.628 --> 00:08:11.939
So we have a event.key, event.which and event.code.

201
00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:13.562
So key is probably the best to go about it.

202
00:08:13.562 --> 00:08:15.710
So key is probably the best to go about it.

203
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.570
There's also just a big table

204
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.060
of all of them available there.

205
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.720
So that's Keycode.info if you want that info here.

206
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.350
So we can say is if the event.type=='click' or

207
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.303
So we can say is if the event.type=='click' or

208
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.700
and I know we haven't gone into this flow control

209
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.920
too much just yet.

210
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.780
So don't worry too much about this until we get into that

211
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.340
Or the event.key === 'Enter'.

212
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.940
Or the event.key === 'Enter'.

213
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.883
Triple equals.

214
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.500
Then you go ahead and you click the photo.

215
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.937
Now tab tab tab tab tab enter,

216
00:08:53.937 --> 00:08:55.900
Now tab tab tab tab tab enter,

217
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.010
you click the photo not it's totally accessible.

218
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.760
So those are easy things to forget,

219
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.590
but almost always it's like.

220
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.950
An extra 10 minutes worth of work to make sure that you

221
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.313
do those things in there are accessible.

222
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.440
The other thing I want to mention real quick

223
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.620
is custom events.

224
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.670
We're not going to go through them like I'm doing here,

225
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.543
but we will be doing them a lot in all of our exercises.
