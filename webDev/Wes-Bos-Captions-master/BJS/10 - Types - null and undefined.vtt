(bright electronic music)

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Instructor>All right, now let's talk about</v>

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.130
null and undefined.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.810
So there's two ways to sort of express nothing in JavaScript

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.920
and they are with undefined and null.

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.490
So if we create a variable and don't set anything to it,

7
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.790
so lets' say let dog and then we console.log(dog)

8
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.700
what is going to be?

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.260
It's actually this thing that is called undefined.

10
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.540
In undefined is essentially

11
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.360
something that has been created a variable,

12
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.380
but yet is not yet defined.

13
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.930
Same thing that actually goes for properties

14
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.880
on something that don't exist.

15
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.470
If we go back to this person object we had

16
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.640
and we say like person.age, there's also a value there,

17
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.650
but if we do person.dog, it gives us undefined.

18
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.140
Why? 'Cause there's nothing there, right?

19
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.710
So that's what undefined is.

20
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.130
Undefined comes about when you tried to access

21
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.520
either a variable which has been created, but not set,

22
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.880
so that's the difference.

23
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.130
'Cause if I just go on and grab

24
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.800
some random variable like wes,

25
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.730
we get an error, 'cause wes is not defined (chuckles).

26
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.040
It's just kind of confusing,

27
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.940
but I've never created a variable.

28
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.050
But here I've created a dog variable,

29
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.220
but I've not yet set any value to it.

30
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.480
So by default the browser will set that

31
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.510
to undefined until we go ahead

32
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.610
and actually set it to something like this

33
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.210
and then you see the dog is actually set to a string.

34
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.610
So that's what undefined is.

35
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.493
The other one we have is null.

36
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.660
So these values right here, dog is undefined,

37
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.350
but where does null come in?

38
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.380
Null is a value of nothing,

39
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.700
whereas undefined is

40
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.961
a variable that has not yet have a value set to it.

41
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:57.710
So let me show you the example.

42
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.690
So const somethingUndefined is that,

43
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.777
and then we also wanna look at const somethingNull

44
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.640
and that has to be explicitly set to null

45
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.830
before it can actually be null.

46
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.000
So undefined is something that has no value set to it.

47
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.140
Null is something that has a value of nothing.

48
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.280
So I was just like looking for an example.

49
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.460
Oh, my, how can I explain this?

50
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.630
'Cause this is such a confusing and they're both nothing,

51
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.190
but they're both nothing in different ways.

52
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.160
And I found this concept of Mononymous person.

53
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.680
So somebody like Cher, I don't what Cher's last name is.

54
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.890
So Cher, const cher

55
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.830
is equal to an object

56
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.710
and the first name is cher

57
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.740
and I don't know what Cher's last name is,

58
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.370
I bet she doesn't even have one.

59
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.730
So let's go and take a look at what her last name is.

60
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.373
Oh, missing initializer on line 63,

61
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.460
const somethingUndefined.

62
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.373
Oh, I gotta,

63
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.640
because you cannot const a value

64
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.040
where it has no value to it,

65
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.810
so you have to make it a let

66
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.643
in order for it be undefined.

67
00:03:15.643 --> 00:03:16.670
There we go. Okay.

68
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.100
Anyway, let's back with Cher.

69
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.800
Cher is an object, but Cher's last name is undefined,

70
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.130
'cause it's never been set.

71
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.100
She was born with no last name.

72
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.870
Whereas, I found a really cool example,

73
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.400
Penn and Teller, legally...

74
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.803
Let me bump this up for you.

75
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.160
Penn and Teller, legally,

76
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.780
so Teller from Penn and Teller,

77
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.300
legally changed his original polynym, Raymond Joseph Teller

78
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.090
to the mononym "Teller"

79
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.810
and possesses a United States passport

80
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.860
issued with a single name.

81
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.990
So, therefore, what he did in his life

82
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.917
is const teller is equal to his first name was Raymond

83
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.140
and last name was Teller

84
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.440
and then what he did is he said teller.first

85
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.120
is equal to Teller

86
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.670
and then teller.last is equal to null,

87
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.030
so he explicitly set his last name to be nothing

88
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.940
with a null value.

89
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.530
And then if anyone want to ever to look it up,

90
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.180
so let's take a look here, teller.last

91
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.990
is a value of null,

92
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.030
whereas, cher.last is undefined,

93
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.990
'cause she probably never had a last name,

94
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.040
we don't know.

95
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.350
It can't be known, nobody knows.

96
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.180
And that's goes a little bit deeper

97
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.710
if you where to get into the delete keyword

98
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.540
where a delete keyword will allow you

99
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.350
to delete properties on an object,

100
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.510
but that's for another video.

101
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.260
We're gonna stop it right here and jump in to next one.
