00:00:00.581 --> 00:00:03.748
(funky hip-hop music)

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.940
<v Male Instructor>All right we'll do the slider one.</v>

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.740
This one's a little bit easier because there

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.680
are no adding and removing of events.

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.760
Well there are lots of adding,

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.270
but there's no removing of events that

7
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.880
need to happen here,

8
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.820
so it's a little bit easier

9
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.800
there's no binding and things like that.

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.990
So let's open up slider

11
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.650
and we'll open up

12
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.743
our index.js.

13
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.070
And let's take a copy of that and call it

14
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.913
index-prototype.

15
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.220
Gonna go into my index.html, go to where I sourced it,

16
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.563
and say index-prototype.js.

17
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.713
And we will run npm start to get this sucker going.

18
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.370
Open it up

19
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.770
make sure this stuff still works

20
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.603
beautiful.

21
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.150
All right so let's start.

22
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.740 line:15% 
First, we have our sliders at the bottom

23
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.610 line:15% 
let's grab both of these sliders and console log them,

24
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.963 line:15% 
just the same idea that we did before.

25
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.500 line:15% 
Console.log mySlider and dogSlider.

26
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.480
Refresh and we get undefined undefined

27
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.240
these objects here are from line eighteen

28
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.510 line:15% 
you can get rid of those if it's confusing

29
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.343 line:15% 
you as to what they are.

30
00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:17.570
Here we go undefined undefined.

31
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.403
Okay good.

32
00:01:18.403 --> 00:01:19.840
Now let's do the same thing we did last time

33
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.261
and let's just add a new key word inside of that.

34
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:24.190
And what that will do is it will create

35
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.710
a new incense of the slider for each of

36
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.330
those variables that I have.

37
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.610
And now you'll see we have our slider

38
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.180
and they each have their prototypes

39
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.140
and there's nothing in them.

40
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.160
Okay making sense making sense so far.

41
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.770
So let's just go top to bottom.

42
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.620
This is fine

43
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.100
for saying what we have there.

44
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.580
These "lets" need to be changed to

45
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.650
this.

46
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.763
But let's actually use the same method we did before.

47
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.400
Rename this one

48
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.303
to this.

49
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.500
And this one

50
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.851
is renamed to this.

51
00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:02.291
And of course you cannot

52
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:05.970
have variable declarations on properties

53
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.803
so

54
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.340
actually we don't even need those at all!

55
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.790
I just renamed them and maybe that practice

56
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.090
is still helpful to rename it,

57
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.923
because you see it

58
00:02:16.923 --> 00:02:18.550
It renamed it down here,

59
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.660
it renamed it right here

60
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.440
renamed it right here

61
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.240
It renamed it all throughout the app

62
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.330
but there's no sense in making these variables

63
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.570
when their properties,

64
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.240
because properties can be added at any time

65
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.060
I was only declaring those variables so

66
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.740
that we had a closure where those variables

67
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.573
were available.

68
00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.850
So we'll go ahead and delete those.

69
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.010
Now theses ones also need to be this.ed

70
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.220
So lets go and rename

71
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.053
those.

72
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.730
And

73
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.980
this prevButton

74
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.520
is only

75
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.809
accessible inside

76
00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.410
of the constructor

77
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.020
when we addEventListener.

78
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.010
So they are not needed anywhere inside

79
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.040
of the prototype method,

80
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.670
so it's not necessary to put it on this.

81
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.340
So these two can stay as variables

82
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.130
this one can be this.slides

83
00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:15.820
So lets move all of these methods out.

84
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.960
We'll grab startSlider and we'll go all

85
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.150
the way down

86
00:03:21.321 --> 00:03:22.790
to right here.

87
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.370
And we leave these kickstarters

88
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.210
as well as these button event listeners

89
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.730
so remove that.

90
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.730
And I'll go below it

91
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.610
paste them in

92
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.979
and I'm gonna grab move

93
00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:38.659
applyClasses

94
00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:39.576
startSlider

95
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.380
and

96
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.890
is that it?

97
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.900
Yeah.

98
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.610
So it's just three this time.

99
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.150
We'll change it to this.

100
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.080
No not this.

101
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.200
It's slider.prototype

102
00:03:54.437 --> 00:03:57.623
.startSlider is equal to function.

103
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.970
Okay then we need to do a little bit of

104
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.170
red squiggle clean up here.

105
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.790
So startSlider is now gonna be this.startSlider

106
00:04:09.956 --> 00:04:11.283
and this.applyClasses

107
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.393
is moves are going to now be this.move.

108
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.290
Slider, if you want to reference the current slider

109
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.900
it's this.slider.

110
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.473
Remember we stuck it on this right here.

111
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.810
And it'll be

112
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.457
this.applyClasses.

113
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.740
Let's go to our browser now and refresh

114
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.700
and see what errors we're getting.

115
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.420
So it probably won't work

116
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.520
now it doesn't work.

117
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.410
And we get cannot read property "querySelector"

118
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.730
of undefined

119
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.750
it gives us this nice little stack trace meaning

120
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.160
it happened at line sixty-three.

121
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.740
So line sixty-three

122
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.430
that's not helpful at all.

123
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.003
That's the end of my file.

124
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.100
Then we'll go a little bit deeper

125
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.265
sixty-three, sixty-three

126
00:04:57.265 --> 00:04:58.098
there we go forty-one.

127
00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:01.693
Line forty-one is where the call happened.

128
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.873
That's not helpful either.

129
00:05:09.933 --> 00:05:13.070
Okay what if we click on that.

130
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.993
Problem with console log?

131
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.230
Sometimes you get these errors like

132
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.650
I don't know if it's transpilation or something,

133
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.450
but that's not giving

134
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.050
that's not giving me a very good

135
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.030
pointer to where it's going.

136
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.040
So let's just kinda figure this out ourselves.

137
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.100
querySelector of undefined,

138
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.690
so where are we using querySelector?

139
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.523
There we go.

140
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.800
Slider slider slider

141
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.960
those should be fine,

142
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.640
cause we're passing in the slider.

143
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.540
Where else are we using querySelector?

144
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.847
This.slider.querySelector...

145
00:05:49.436 --> 00:05:50.269
Okay.

146
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.470
So I have an inkling that it might be

147
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.323
this one?

148
00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:07.870
Let's try.

149
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.773
Console.log slider.

150
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.295
No that's our slider it should be fine.

151
00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:16.520
So where else are we using querySelector?

152
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.353
Right here.

153
00:06:17.353 --> 00:06:20.460
So this startSlider function is not

154
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.810
able to access this slider.

155
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.910
So what I'll say is I'll console.log this

156
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.293
or let's throw a debugger in there.

157
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.373
There we go.

158
00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:36.560
And let's see

159
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.393
what we've got

160
00:06:37.393 --> 00:06:40.000
We've got a call stack, startSlider.

161
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.150
Our local this is equal to the slider.

162
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.090
So this.slides

163
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.910
this.slide

164
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.930
We have our global

165
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.370
Okay so I don't see slider on.

166
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.750
Oh okay.

167
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.500
So for some reason I don't see the rest

168
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.700
of my properties at this point in time

169
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.780
this is why debuggers is helpful,

170
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.630
because you're able to pause it at that point in time.

171
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.258
So whenever this startSlider is running,

172
00:07:10.258 --> 00:07:13.300
this.slider doesn't exist yet.

173
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.630
So let's look

174
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.870
and

175
00:07:19.978 --> 00:07:22.499
oh we didn't save reference to the slider ever.

176
00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:23.380
(laughs)

177
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.220
So that's a problem.

178
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.520
So let's say this.slider is equal to slider,

179
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.010
because the slider that gets pasted in,

180
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.330
needs to be saved on the instance,

181
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.950
because we need to querySelector it in the future.

182
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.200
All right refresh that.

183
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.120
Console

184
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.730
Okay our next problem.

185
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.510 line:15% 
Cannot read property "classlist" of

186
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.473 line:15% 
undefined on line thirty-eight.

187
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.370
All right we've we got going on

188
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.300
on line thirty-eight?

189
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.690
This.prev.classList.remove

190
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.500
so it's trying to tell me this.prev is undefined.

191
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.573
So lets console.log this.

192
00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:02.670
And so when I hit next

193
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.940
this is equal to our button.

194
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.860
And our prev actually works.

195
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.630
But our next doesn't work.

196
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.463
Okay

197
00:08:10.463 --> 00:08:11.296
so

198
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.698
we'll go to where we have listened to our move.

199
00:08:16.698 --> 00:08:19.660
Let's go back up to our constructor

200
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.002
and we're saying that the next is broken,

201
00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.080
but the previous is not.

202
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.100
And that's because

203
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.630
here we've just past reference to the function,

204
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.160
and it's being rebound.

205
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.830
And in this case we're actually passing

206
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.300
it in an annonymous function,

207
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.550
which is an arrow.

208
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.750
So this can be solved one of two ways,

209
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.820
it can bind it with this,

210
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.930
and that will work.

211
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.360
And the reason why we're allowed to do that here

212
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.560
is because we're not removing the EventListener,

213
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.670
so we don't actually need reference to

214
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.750
the new this.move that we bound.

215
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.890
The other thing we could do

216
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.680
and this is what is pretty popular in react world

217
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.730
is to do a little arrow function

218
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.563
like that.

219
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.210
You actually have to call the function yourself,

220
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.180
otherwise it doesn't work.

221
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.320
There we go that works just fine.

222
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.170
And then of course the other way we did it

223
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.130
is we just said this.move is equal to

224
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.480
this.move.bind

225
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.313
this.

226
00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:20.842
And that works as well.

227
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.700
Let me double check that actually does work

228
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.610
this.move

229
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.200
That works just fine as well.

230
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.780
I'm going to keep it the same

231
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.970
so lets use a arrow function in this case.

232
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.040
Again what that does is it

233
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.440
this arrow function will have bound and not the this.move,

234
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.380
which is what we want.

235
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.213
Why?

236
00:09:42.213 --> 00:09:43.046
Because

237
00:09:43.046 --> 00:09:46.690
this.move needs access to the instance

238
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.840
in order to reference the previous, the next,

239
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.100
and the current dom elements.

240
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.960
So that's working

241
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.400
and I believe

242
00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.023
that is it.

243
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.020
Working good!

244
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.633
So that is our slider.

245
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.600
Last thing I wanna just say is like these right here

246
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.390
the prev button and the next button?

247
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.570
Why didn't we say this.prevButton?

248
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.430
It's because we don't need them anywhere

249
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.800
outside of this constructor.

250
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.140
So if that's the case,

251
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.870
keep them as regular variables,

252
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.200
and just reference them when you need

253
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.530
them inside this function.

254
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.340
The one kind of cool thing about this is

255
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.950
if I take my

256
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.783
dogSlider

257
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.850
and

258
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.120
I cannot

259
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.010
access it as dogSlider when we're using parcel.

260
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.730
So if we wanna be able to access it,

261
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:35.740
we have to say something like

262
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.397
window.dogSlider is equal to dogSlider.

263
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.660
Or you can right click store as global variable.

264
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.670
But now we see our dogSlider,

265
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.470
and the cool thing about that is

266
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.120
you can now hook up

267
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.190
the move

268
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.569
function yourself.

269
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:56.240
And it will just run via the command line for you.

270
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.020
So what I could do is I could just

271
00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.090
like totally right here

272
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.187
just say window.addEventListener

273
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.948
keyup

274
00:11:06.948 --> 00:11:08.267
and when that runs event

275
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.730
we can say if the e.key

276
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.080
is equal to

277
00:11:17.171 --> 00:11:18.004
ArrowRight

278
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.240
then

279
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.640
would just say dogSlider.move.

280
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.840
And then we could have another one for the backer

281
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.870
lets make sure that works,

282
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.240
and watch now my

283
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.330
my keys should work.

284
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.230
Yeah look at that!

285
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.580
I'm hitting my right key and it's moving.

286
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.600
And that's the beauty,

287
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.020
because you the developer could build this thing,

288
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.930
and you can surface the functionality via methods.

289
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.630
And you can let other developers on your team

290
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.650
people are using your plugin to be able to

291
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.810
hook into the functionality of your slider

292
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.480
by adding their own

293
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.800
custom EventListeners on it.

294
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.700
In this case I'm just doing dogSlider,

295
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.533
right?

296
00:11:56.533 --> 00:11:59.230
And this one doesn't work at all,

297
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.800
but you could write some more logic

298
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.014
that would do them all.

299
00:12:02.014 --> 00:12:04.070
Let's duplicate it

300
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:04.903
arrow

301
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.700
left

302
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.690
I wanna just say move

303
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.523
back.

304
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.720
So lets see my arrow keys.

305
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.553
Boom boom!

306
00:12:15.553 --> 00:12:16.386
Boom boom boom!

307
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.760
Amazing!

308
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.060
So I'll leave that in there just to

309
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.330
show you how to do that,

310
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.893
and I'll catch you in the next one.
