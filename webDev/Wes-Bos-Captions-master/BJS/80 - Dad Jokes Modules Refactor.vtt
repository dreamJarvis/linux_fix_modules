00:00:00.716 --> 00:00:03.299
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Instructor>All right, let's refactor the dad jokes</v>

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.293
and the currency conversion ones to use modules

4
00:00:10.293 --> 00:00:12.796
just so you can see how I would structure all of that.

5
00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:14.380
So what I want you to do is

6
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.730
first let's do dad jokes,

7
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.430
and I want to duplicate that into a new folder.

8
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.223
And this one is 77 dad jokes modules.

9
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.103
Okay, good.

10
00:00:27.103 --> 00:00:28.810
Now, first thing we need to do

11
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.940
is open up our index.html,

12
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.989
and I'm taking all the finished text

13
00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.520
and putting it into my jokes J S

14
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.433
because I don't need the finished version.

15
00:00:43.538 --> 00:00:46.140
Now we'll go into our index.html

16
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.432
and the first thing we need to do to convert it

17
00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:50.580
to modules is you just put a type of module

18
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.312
onto your attribute of your script tag

19
00:00:53.312 --> 00:00:55.530
and then the second thing is we need to run

20
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.833
it under a server.

21
00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:58.420
So I'm gonna right click,

22
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.968
open with live server,

23
00:00:59.968 --> 00:01:01.883
now we've got our dad jokes.

24
00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:05.140
Everything is working just as we had left it,

25
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.277
that's great.

26
00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:07.828
Now I'm gonna go into my joke J S

27
00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:10.050
and just scan it real quick.

28
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.855
Okay, so my entry point is going to be jokes J S

29
00:01:13.855 --> 00:01:15.880
and in my entry point I like to do

30
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.700
a lot of my selecting.

31
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.320
Selecting in my event listeners

32
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.530
but everything else,

33
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.410
all of my data,

34
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.740
all of my functionality

35
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.117
and all of my utilities

36
00:01:31.117 --> 00:01:34.902
and all of my handlers are going to be in separate files

37
00:01:34.902 --> 00:01:36.510
in their own modules.

38
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.200
So let's go function by function,

39
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.033
line by line.

40
00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.000
So these are all fine, I'll keep those there.

41
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.400
Now, this button text,

42
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.603
where would I put that?

43
00:01:46.603 --> 00:01:48.720
I would probably put that in it's own file

44
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.003
just so I can stay sane with that.

45
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:54.700
So we're gonna go into our 77

46
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.297
and I'll make a new file.

47
00:01:56.297 --> 00:02:00.060
Sometimes people will even make a folder,

48
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.540
maybe they'll call it data.

49
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.600
Let's do that

50
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.480
and then in data we'll call buttontext.js

51
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.920
and I'm gonna cut this button text

52
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.860
and paste it into here.

53
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.790
Okay good.

54
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.078
I'm not gonna worry about importing anything

55
00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:19.720
I just want to get all of these different function

56
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.686
into their own files

57
00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:24.143
before we can go ahead and do that.

58
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.740
Next is this fetch joke function.

59
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.720
So often this is core to what the application does.

60
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.120
So often people will make a lib folder for this.

61
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.947
So they'll go in here,

62
00:02:40.947 --> 00:02:41.780
make a new folder,

63
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.962
they'll call that lib.

64
00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:44.810
You don't have to make these.

65
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.343
I often find it a little bit confusing

66
00:02:46.343 --> 00:02:48.306
when people have hundreds of folders

67
00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:50.930
for organization sake.

68
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.473
So feel free to just make files in your root directory

69
00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:57.660
or make a scripts folder and throw them all in there

70
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.379
and then as you find yourself having too many files

71
00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.440
then you can re-look at it.

72
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.000
So I'll do it this way just because people

73
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.170
like to see what is a big app built like.

74
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.180
In the lib

75
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.151
we will make a index.js

76
00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:19.990
and that will contain all of your library JavaScript.

77
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.653
So I'm going to remove that and put it in here.

78
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.102
And the one thing I'm seeing right now

79
00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:30.550
is there's red because this a loader

80
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.260
and you need to pass it reference to the loader

81
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.758
because, remember how I said that modules have

82
00:03:35.758 --> 00:03:40.410
their own scope, well now we're not able to reference it.

83
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.030
So two ways we could fix this is we could either select

84
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.883
the loader inside of this function or we could pass it in.

85
00:03:48.883 --> 00:03:53.505
And I think passing in the loader is the better idea.

86
00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:56.011
So what we're gonna do is we'll pass in the loader

87
00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:59.949
and then we'll modify the fetching

88
00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.540
of the joke function

89
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.273
and pass it reference to our loader.

90
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.263
Okay, good.

91
00:04:09.263 --> 00:04:10.670
I'm happy with that.

92
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.920
Also we should probably export this one

93
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.853
and our button text,

94
00:04:15.853 --> 00:04:17.604
this will be a default export.

95
00:04:17.604 --> 00:04:20.093
So export default button text.

96
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.842
So why is this its own?

97
00:04:23.842 --> 00:04:27.050
Because I think this is all this file is going to do.

98
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.429
So that's the main export

99
00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:31.260
whereas my index J S and my lib folder,

100
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.015
this will contain multiple functions.

101
00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:37.029
Eventually when we build out the big dad joke app

102
00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:38.650
and it's not something we're doing

103
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.678
but if you were to build a larger application

104
00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:44.617
you'd probably have multiple library functions

105
00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.010
in here that you would do.

106
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.671
So we will make this a--

107
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:49.020
we'll put a little comment,

108
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.500
this is a named export.

109
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.060
We can have lots of these.

110
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.100
This is a default export,

111
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.360
only one per file.

112
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.193
Okay, good.

113
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.367
Next up, random item from array.

114
00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:09.156
Okay so that is a util,

115
00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:13.120
I'll probably make a utils.js file

116
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.036
inside of my lib.

117
00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:17.360
Other people will make an entire folder dedicated

118
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.830
to utils, it doesn't matter,

119
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.684
it really just comes down to how many utils do you have.

120
00:05:23.684 --> 00:05:25.950
I'm gonna make my own little file.

121
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.360
I like to just always have utils.js

122
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.610
and I stick anything I want in there.

123
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.730
And then if it gets to large

124
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.940
I'll break it out into separate functions.

125
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.720
I think that's my main thing I want to tell you here is

126
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.660
don't sweat it,

127
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.788
your structure will change over time.

128
00:05:42.788 --> 00:05:45.074
Keep it as simple as possible off the bat.

129
00:05:45.074 --> 00:05:49.160
You can always go back and refactor it later.

130
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.090
Okay, so random item from aray.

131
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.534
So get rid of that.

132
00:05:53.534 --> 00:05:54.980
Go into my utils

133
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.333
and we'll just export that, right?

134
00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:01.760
That's a named export,

135
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.290
named export, good.

136
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.163
And then next handle click, okay.

137
00:06:09.664 --> 00:06:13.549
That's a handler so I'll make another file.

138
00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:14.596
I could put this in lib,

139
00:06:14.596 --> 00:06:16.050
yeah I think I'll do that.

140
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.730
I'll call it handlers.js

141
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.850
and we will export that.

142
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.203
That again is a named export.

143
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.900
And all right, I think we're in good shape right now.

144
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.549
Now what I like to do when I re-factor it

145
00:06:30.549 --> 00:06:33.656
because it's obviously going to be very broken right now.

146
00:06:33.656 --> 00:06:37.760
You can sort of just go either by errors in your console

147
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.620
or by ESLint errors depending on what you like.

148
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.309
Let's do it in the console.

149
00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.330
So handle click is not defined.

150
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.163
Why not?

151
00:06:47.163 --> 00:06:49.000
Well because we moved handle click

152
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.708
outside of this so if we need

153
00:06:52.708 --> 00:06:55.390
to pass handle click here we need to import it.

154
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.379
So we'll go to the very top

155
00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:01.240
and we'll import curly bracket,

156
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.080
handle click

157
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.913
from

158
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.750
it's in our lib

159
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.793
and it's in our handlers.js.

160
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.093
All right, that's the first error.

161
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.832
Now there's seems to be no errors

162
00:07:15.832 --> 00:07:18.083
but I bet if I click it I'll get another one.

163
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.685
Uncaught reference error fetch joke is not defined

164
00:07:21.685 --> 00:07:23.750
in handlers.js, okay.

165
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.260
So here is something I really wanted to tell you.

166
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.690
So I need the fetch joke function here.

167
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.130
So do I import fetch joke into here,

168
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.440
into my entry point,

169
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.997
or do I import into here?

170
00:07:38.997 --> 00:07:42.086
And the answer is you always import it where you need it.

171
00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:45.230
Even if you've already imported it into another file.

172
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:50.230
So if I imported fetch joke from,

173
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.012
what is it?

174
00:07:53.012 --> 00:07:53.845
It's in our lib

175
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.073
index.js.

176
00:07:57.954 --> 00:08:01.880
If I did that it still errors out.

177
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.100
Fetch joke is not defined, why?

178
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.380
Because even though you import it in your entry

179
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.290
then you also still have to import it into

180
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.123
where you need it.

181
00:08:12.123 --> 00:08:15.315
In fact there's no sense in importing in here

182
00:08:15.315 --> 00:08:18.762
but you'll see it's yellow because we've never used it.

183
00:08:18.762 --> 00:08:21.730
So there's no sense in importing things into a file

184
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.852
where they're not used.

185
00:08:22.852 --> 00:08:25.640
You simply import it where you need it.

186
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.593
So import,

187
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.770
fetch joke from

188
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.026
and now we'll go to our index.js.

189
00:08:35.026 --> 00:08:37.470
You know I'm not in the lib folder anymore

190
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:41.473
because handlers is a sibling to index.js.

191
00:08:42.524 --> 00:08:43.825
So that looks like it's working.

192
00:08:43.825 --> 00:08:45.913
Now let's keep going.

193
00:08:47.295 --> 00:08:48.890
Oh here we go,

194
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.940
four 0 four not found.

195
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.961
Oh it's because I forgot the .js on the end.

196
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:56.640
All right now next error, loader is not defined.

197
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.640
Okay, so we modified this fetch joke function

198
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.562
to take in a loader but now we're calling it

199
00:09:05.562 --> 00:09:10.562
from a separate file so how do we pass that?

200
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.570
Well our handle click now has to take an argument

201
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.683
so we could do this.

202
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.033
We could just pass another function here.

203
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.620
There,

204
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.640
and we'll pass it our loader.

205
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.533
So that's one way to do it.

206
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.380
And that looks like it still is not defined on handlers

207
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.177
because we have to modify this handle click

208
00:09:39.177 --> 00:09:40.860
to take in the loader then.

209
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.204
There we go the loader shows up.

210
00:09:43.204 --> 00:09:44.400
That's good.

211
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.860
Another way we could have done that is

212
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.850
we say dot bind

213
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.552
and null because we don't care about this,

214
00:09:55.552 --> 00:09:57.533
we're not using this so we don't care,

215
00:09:57.533 --> 00:09:59.060
we just pass null

216
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.922
and then we pass it the arguments

217
00:10:00.922 --> 00:10:02.303
which is loader.

218
00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:07.120
That works exactly the same way

219
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.725
and then finally we could have also done

220
00:10:08.725 --> 00:10:10.670
a regular function

221
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.719
that in term, this is anonymous function

222
00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:18.987
that in term will call handle click

223
00:10:18.987 --> 00:10:20.614
and you pass it our loader.

224
00:10:20.614 --> 00:10:23.104
So sometimes you'll have to hot potato

225
00:10:23.104 --> 00:10:26.190
your loader from where you selected it

226
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.300
to handle click

227
00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:31.260
and then once more from handle click

228
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.990
to fetch joke.

229
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.210
We certainly could have also selected it

230
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.646
right inside of this handle click as well.

231
00:10:38.646 --> 00:10:40.316
That's up to you whether you like to do that.

232
00:10:40.316 --> 00:10:43.040
There's pros and cons to both of it.

233
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.000
Next thing we have here is joke holder is not defined

234
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.561
so now we're getting into a bit of a problem.

235
00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:48.394
Okay,

236
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.500
handle click needs the loader,

237
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.574
we sort of saw how we could solve that

238
00:10:53.574 --> 00:10:57.200
but now we also need the span and the joke holder

239
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.020
so do we modify that to take two more arguments?

240
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:01.853
So another way that we could do that

241
00:11:01.853 --> 00:11:03.322
is we can just create another module

242
00:11:03.322 --> 00:11:06.460
that will do all of our selecting.

243
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.078
So we'll go into,

244
00:11:08.078 --> 00:11:10.500
let's go into our lib

245
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.960
and let's call it elements.js

246
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.101
and let's take all of these, boom,

247
00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:21.695
put it in here and we'll just put an export

248
00:11:21.695 --> 00:11:24.190
in front of them all.

249
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.023
Export.

250
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.520
Then what we can do is we no longer have

251
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.940
to pass the loader,

252
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.800
let's do the loader first,

253
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.890
call it handle click

254
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.725
and of course we need our joke button

255
00:11:36.725 --> 00:11:39.320
in order to be able to click it so import

256
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.250
joke button

257
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:44.683
from

258
00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.913
lib elements.js.

259
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.381
So that works

260
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:59.388
and then we'll go into our handler here

261
00:11:59.388 --> 00:12:02.820
and we no longer have to pass the loader

262
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.482
and we can take the loader,

263
00:12:04.482 --> 00:12:07.200
the joke holder, the joke button span

264
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.250
and

265
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.848
that is it so far.

266
00:12:12.848 --> 00:12:15.403
And we'll import all of those at once.

267
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.080
So import those three

268
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.913
from elements.js.

269
00:12:27.986 --> 00:12:28.986
There we go.

270
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.107
Good that seemed to actually fetch a joke

271
00:12:32.107 --> 00:12:33.950
and display it.

272
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.870
Now we've got our next problem,

273
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.393
random item from array is not defined.

274
00:12:37.393 --> 00:12:38.291
Okay, well we already did that,

275
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:40.799
we stuck that in our utils J S

276
00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:42.383
so we can import it.

277
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.563
Import

278
00:12:45.479 --> 00:12:50.330
random item from array from utils.js

279
00:12:51.544 --> 00:12:52.958
and give me another error,

280
00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.481
button text is not defined.

281
00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:56.910
Okay so random item from array

282
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.301
needs an array so where is that array?

283
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:03.742
That's stored in data button text,

284
00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:04.900
oh we can do that

285
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.060
so import

286
00:13:08.302 --> 00:13:10.664
button text so this is a default

287
00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:13.330
so we don't have to do curly brackets

288
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.052
from we gotta go up a level

289
00:13:17.052 --> 00:13:20.893
into our data folder and get buttontext.js.

290
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.050
And it works!

291
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.720
Beautiful, so you see how we chopped that up.

292
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.937
It sometimes for beginners might thinks like,

293
00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:32.977
"That seems way harder

294
00:13:32.977 --> 00:13:34.744
"because now everything's in different files

295
00:13:34.744 --> 00:13:36.763
"I don't necessarily know where to go."

296
00:13:36.763 --> 00:13:38.029
And I have an error.

297
00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:40.640
This is where you really need to get good

298
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.124
at following your stack traces and seeing

299
00:13:43.124 --> 00:13:44.500
where everything goes.

300
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.050
But long term for maintainability

301
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:52.050
and shareability this approach is much better.

302
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.480
In the next one let's go ahead

303
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.886
and do the currency conversion

304
00:13:55.886 --> 00:13:57.823
and convert that to modules.
