00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.203
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.830
<v Instructor>Another common thing that we do in JavaScript</v>

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.680
is adding and removing of classes

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.140
and it's a little bit different than just using properties

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.200
like we've used so far

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.950
so let's dive into how this all works.

7
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.450
So I'm actually just gonna comment out,

8
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.283
(mouse clicking)

9
00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:22.130
let's comment out everything.

10
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.070
Let's start fresh.

11
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.530
So we'll go down and we'll say classes.

12
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.740
So when you select an element, there is a classList

13
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.680
attribute on that and on that, there are some methods

14
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.500
for getting all of the classes

15
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.710
as well as removing and adding and removing

16
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.590
multiple classes.

17
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.510
So let's go and find, let's do something fun.

18
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.880
Maybe we'll do some animation.

19
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.650
So let's grab this image here and...

20
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.870
Let's create just like a brand new image

21
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.160
so copy one of these images, go up here

22
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.140
if it's not already there and give yourself

23
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.660
a nice big 600 pixel image.

24
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.920
(whistles)

25
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.290
Nice rocks.

26
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.290
Let's go ahead and give that a class of nice.

27
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.300
And we'll go ahead and select it

28
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.380
so const pic is equal to document.querySelector,

29
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.840
we'll grab the image with a class of nice

30
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.237
and we'll console.log the pic.classList.

31
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.120
Now, if we open up our dev tools here,

32
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.410
you'll see that we get this thing which is a DOMTokenList

33
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.120
and it will give, it's kind of like an array of all

34
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.920
of the classes that are on that image.

35
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.793
Now, if we go ahead and add another nice and cool,

36
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.600
you'll see that we get both of them.

37
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.240
And it will also give us a value

38
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.990
of all of the classes on there.

39
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.700
So that's pretty cool because we can be able to add them.

40
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.860
However, if you look in the prototype, we're gonna,

41
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.230
we haven't learned what the prototype is just yet

42
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.520
but if you sneak into the prototype,

43
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.570
you're often able to see what are the methods

44
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.750
that you're able to call against the thing that we have.

45
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.030
So classList has a prototype

46
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.070
and in that there's all kinds of adds, contains,

47
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.983
entries, forEach, items, keys.

48
00:02:11.983 --> 00:02:15.140
A lot of these are methods for working with the classes

49
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.960
so that's exactly what we're gonna do here.

50
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.523
So what we can do is take that pic.classList

51
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.820
and we can run .add, you see actually even my VS Code

52
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.610
is giving me like commonly used ones,

53
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.540
like these little stars.

54
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.010
These are ones that I use a lot in my own coding.

55
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.920
Add, remove, contains, and toggle

56
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.350
so add if I wanna add a class of dog.

57
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.290
Or maybe we'll say open

58
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.387
and then when I run the code and inspect that

59
00:02:44.387 --> 00:02:48.700
and see that it's there, maybe you can also remove

60
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.340
a class of cool.

61
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.463
And now when we run it, you see it's gone.

62
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.410
There is toggle, which is pretty cool.

63
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.210
So let's actually write a little bit of CSS

64
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.140
so we can visually see what's going on here.

65
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.030
So let's go just to here

66
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.190
and we've got style tag.

67
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.470
If not, just give yourself a style tag somewhere on the page

68
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.070
and let's just give ourselves the class of round

69
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.613
and we'll say border-radius: 50%.

70
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.900
Then what we'll do is we will add a class of round.

71
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.807
So pic.classList.add('round')

72
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.890
Now, when we refresh, it's obviously got a class of round.

73
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.710
The kinda cool thing about that is that we can add

74
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.710
and remove that class either by placing it into the console

75
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.940
or we can do it on click.

76
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.780
Let's show you both.

77
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.800
So let's say classList.toggle,

78
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.320
that will add it if it's not there

79
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.090
and remove it if it is there.

80
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.210
So look at that.

81
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.419
Beautiful.

82
00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.650
And we can just copy that and paste it into our console

83
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.100
to just see that it adds and removes it.

84
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.100
If we go into our CSS and we add a transition: all 0.2s.

85
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.740
What that will do is every time we run it, it should

86
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.330
woo!

87
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.260
Oh, you know what, it's only animating itself

88
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.620
when it has the class.

89
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.210
So maybe we will grab our image

90
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.720
and add the transition on the image, not the class of round.

91
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.820
Now when you sort of toggle that,

92
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.820
you'll see that it's pretty cool where it like

93
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.170
adds and removes it.

94
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.293
The kinda cool thing about that is we're gonna learn about

95
00:04:33.293 --> 00:04:35.240
events really quickly.

96
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.530
We can peak ahead real quick.

97
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.630
We can say that pic.addEventListener

98
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.160
and then we're going to listen for a click.

99
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.280
And when that happens,

100
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.973
we can run a function.

101
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.740
Actually, maybe we'll make a function down here

102
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.290
called toggleRound

103
00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.130
and all that will do is it will toggle class of round

104
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.520
and then here we can pass a reference to that function.

105
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.910
Again, we haven't learned this yet but stay with me.

106
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.940
I think we can understand what's going on here.

107
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.947
We make a function called toggleRound

108
00:05:09.947 --> 00:05:12.400
that will toggle the classList here

109
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.640
and then we will just, every time we click it,

110
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.050
we'll run that function.

111
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.460
So (imitates object sliding up and down)

112
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.190
you have to make the sounds yourself.

113
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.840
And it's pretty cool because now we can

114
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.360
just go on this round and say things

115
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.247
like transform: rotate(20deg).

116
00:05:36.143 --> 00:05:36.976
Woo!

117
00:05:36.976 --> 00:05:38.893
And then you can go bananas with it.

118
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.010
Woo!

119
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.823
Here, maybe two, let's do 360.

120
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.650
Oh, you can actually, no, you can use turn.

121
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.483
1turn.

122
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.510
Oh!

123
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.583
And we can scale it, 2.

124
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.023
And maybe add a box-shadow:

125
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.503
0 0 10px black.

126
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.960
You get the point, right?

127
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.960
It's pretty cool that a lot of JavaScript interaction

128
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.110
is simply just going to be adding and removing classes

129
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.870
at different points in time.

130
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.120
And that will allow us to then step in with CSS

131
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.190
and add and remove all these different transitions

132
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.023
that we have.

133
00:06:33.023 --> 00:06:37.340
So that's pretty common with things like modals or navs

134
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.700
that need to open and close or slide in from the side

135
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.100
and we'll be doing quite a bit of that in this class.

136
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.940
But just know that we've got this classList here

137
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.940
and we've got add, remove, toggle,

138
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.890
and then also has contains which I don't use all that often

139
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.723
but we could.

140
00:06:52.723 --> 00:06:56.200
So we just say the pic.classList.contains

141
00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.210
is it currently open?

142
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.410
True.

143
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.243
Click it.

144
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.903
True.

145
00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:04.736
Oh no, is it round?

146
00:07:04.736 --> 00:07:06.440
That's what we're looking for, round.

147
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.273
True.

148
00:07:07.273 --> 00:07:08.113
Click it again.

149
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.570
And it should return false to us.

150
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.260
So that will be helpful in situations

151
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.470
if you need to know if something is currently open

152
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.020
or if there's a specific state that you're saving

153
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.300
in the classList.

154
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.420
So that is adding and removing classes.

155
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.730
In the next video, we're going to go

156
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.470
into just regular attributes.

157
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.260
So even though classes is an attribute.

158
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.057
So we can say pic.className,

159
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.740
that will actually just give us

160
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.330
a list of the class.

161
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.040
That's just a property on the element called className.

162
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.530
However, classList gives us some sort of utility functions

163
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.260
or utility methods for working with it.

So any time that you wanna work with classes,

165
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.810
I always reach for classList.

166
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.120
It's somewhat new, a couple years old in the browser.

167
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.310
That's just why that one is existing there.

168
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.560
So with that, I will see you in the next one.
