00:00:00.771 --> 00:00:03.354
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.360
<v Instructor>So the JavaScript we've been writing so far,</v>

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.340
you'll see that we're just sticking values

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.970
into variables with sometimes, it's a number,

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.410
sometimes, it's some text, we've seen true and false,

6
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.230
so what are all these things

7
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.520
and what are all of the different

8
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.060
possible options that we have?

9
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.720
And these are what are referred to in JavaScript as types.

10
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.980
Anytime that you have a value,

11
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.840
and value is something that can be stuck into a variable

12
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.360
or passed to a function like console.log.

13
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.480
So all of those fall into

14
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.400
one of the seven types in JavaScript.

15
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.050
So the types in JavaScript can be remembered

16
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.193
by remembering SNOB N US if...

17
00:00:43.193 --> 00:00:44.390
I'm joking, that's terrible.

18
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.390
You'll never remember that.

19
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.240
Just Google it if you need to remember it,

20
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.670
or memorize it right before you go into a job interview,

21
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.240
but the different types are String.

22
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.450
That's the S.

23
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.373
You get the point.

24
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.470
The different types are String, Number, Object,

25
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.860
Boolean, Null,

26
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.000
Undefined, and Symbol.

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.010
So if we take a look real quick at them,

28
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.430
String is any time that you have some text,

29
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.060
so you'll often see that in a single, a double quote

30
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.160
or a back tick.

31
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.330
We'll talk about that.

32
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.640
Number is obviously a number.

33
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.720
That goes for both numbers that do

34
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.150
and do not have decimal places in them.

35
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.380
Some other languages have different types for numbers

36
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.610
that have decimals and numbers that don't,

37
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.790
like they're floats and integers.

38
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.900
We just have one value in JavaScript, one type.

39
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.570
Object is a bit of a special one.

40
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.680
Let's put that at the end here

41
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.540
because everything in JavaScript is an Object,

42
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.840
and we're gonna understand what that is

43
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.480
when we start to hit methods,

44
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.200
but essentially everything in JavaScript

45
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.033
is an Object,

46
00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:47.950
and a lot of the things that we use,

47
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.940
like functions and arrays and dates,

48
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.580
they are just objects at the end of the day.

49
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.180
So these ones are referred to

50
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.910
as what are the primitive types,

51
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.320
and Object is a bit of a special one.

52
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.330
Then we have Boolean.

53
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.520
That's true or false.

54
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.830
We have Null and Undefined.

55
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.030
Those are two ways to say nothing.

56
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.700
If you wanna set something to nothing,

57
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.950
you can set it to null or undefined.

58
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.570
We'll talk about the difference between those two.

59
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.890
And then Symbol is sort of a new one to JavaScript,

60
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.960
and it will always give us

61
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.150
sort of a guaranteed unique identifier,

62
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.100
and that's helpful for when you are trying

63
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.700
to come up with a unique ID

64
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.010
or unique identifier

65
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.460
inside of an Object

66
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.030
when you wanna make sure you're not accidentally

67
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.690
overwriting something that has also been named that,

68
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.930
so those are the seven types that we have.

69
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.313
SNOB N US or SNOBUSN.

70
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.430
I like to do, as a Canadian...

71
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.263
I'm joking.

72
00:02:42.263 --> 00:02:43.096
Those are terrible.

73
00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.010
You'll never remember those,

74
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.010
but let's get into the next videos

75
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.513
and dive a little deeper on each of the types.
