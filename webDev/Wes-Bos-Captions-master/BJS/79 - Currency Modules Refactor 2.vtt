00:00:00.692 --> 00:00:03.275
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:06.437
<v ->All right, I want to encourage</v>

3
00:00:06.437 --> 00:00:08.140
you to try do this one yourself.

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.990
Take the currency conversion project that we did and

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.373
duplicate it, and try to convert it to modules.

6
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.410
Welcome back

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.870
let's duplicate the currency conversion once.

8
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.163
So, duplicate,

9
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.150
we'll call that 78

10
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.193
dash currency converter modules refactor.

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.960
Open that up and I'm going to get rid of the finished

12
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.423
version, just put it into money JS.

13
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.690
Delete that

14
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.670
and we open up our index.js

15
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.520
and we want to convert this to a module.

16
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.830
So, type equals module, so now money.js

17
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.483
is going to be our entry point.

18
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.010
And let's take a look here, so we got a bunch of selecting,

19
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.550
we've got an endpoint, we have rates by base, which is

20
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.473
needed to store the data,

21
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.713
then we've got our currencies,

22
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.700
okay, then we've got our generate options function,

23
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.020
we've got our fetch rates,

24
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.540
which needs the endpoint,

25
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.730
we got our convert, format currency, handle Input.

26
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.140
So we've got we got one handler here.

27
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.500
We've got format currency,

28
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.160
which is library function.

29
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.120
We got convert,

30
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.770
that's a library function.

31
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.240
Fetch rates, that's a library.

32
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.073
Libraries,

33
00:01:33.073 --> 00:01:34.170
like this is core functionality

34
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.100
to our application.

35
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.820
And then we've got

36
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.120
generate options.

37
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.050
That could either be library

38
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.480
or maybe called a helper,

39
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.900
or a util.

40
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.610
And then we've got some data of the currencies.

41
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.820
So, let's get going.

42
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.560
I'm not going to do any folders for this one,

43
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.593
I'll show you how I would approach this

44
00:01:51.593 --> 00:01:53.440
with just flat files.

45
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.380
So, let's

46
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.430
make a currencies.js.

47
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.400
And let's take all this

48
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.000
and paste it in there.

49
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.260
This is a big enough that I would give it its own file.

50
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.893
Export default currencies.

51
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.450
Okay, now we need

52
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.613
generate options.

53
00:02:15.613 --> 00:02:17.120
I think that's a util,

54
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.260
I'm going to put that in utils.

55
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.973
So make a new file called utils.js,

56
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.400
take that out,

57
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.260
paste it in here,

58
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.603
and we'll do that as a named export.

59
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.630
Then I'm going to make a

60
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.463
lib

61
00:02:33.407 --> 00:02:35.060
.js file

62
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.470
that's going to contain fetch rates,

63
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.433
convert,

64
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.370
format,

65
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.290
ah, format is more of a util, I think.

66
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.890
So just want to move over

67
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.140
convert and fetch rates for now.

68
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.483
We'll put that in our lib.

69
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.190
And we'll export async function fetch Rates.

70
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.340
Export

71
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.440
convert

72
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.930
good.

73
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.840
Format currency, that's a util.

74
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.253
Let's put that in utils.

75
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.563
Okay.

76
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.390
We've got handleInput,

77
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.310
that's a handler.

78
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.483
So let's make a new file here.

79
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.553
Call it handlers.

80
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:23.810
It's an event handler so put it in there,

81
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.083
export that,

82
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.600
and then we got

83
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.510
our generation.

84
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.290
Which we do on page load

85
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.759
so initialization and then we listen for everything.

86
00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:39.653
Okay, okay.

87
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.060
Lets just start going one by one

88
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.690
and see if we want to move these out or not.

89
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.150
I'm actually kind of curious how we will solve this one

90
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.483
which is because it catches and it gets updated each time.

91
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.920
So I'm going to go open up my

92
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.100
index.html

93
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.363
in my live server.

94
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.940
Lets go error by error.

95
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.400
Generate options is not defined.

96
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.330
Okay. Well we'll put that in utils,

97
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.993
so we'll simply just import it.

98
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.870
Currencies is not defined

99
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.330
that needs to be past generate options.

100
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.380
Okay so, import

101
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.200
currencies from

102
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.120
currencies.js

103
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.923
The requested module currencies

104
00:04:44.923 --> 00:04:48.610
does not provide and export named currencies.

105
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.610
Okay, lets go into, Oh! Because its a default export.

106
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.640
So it doesn't need the curly brackets.

107
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.590
Okay, handleInput is not defined.

108
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.700
All right we'll import

109
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.820
handleInput from

110
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.720
you noticed I don't put spaces there?

111
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.820
That's just because I'm using prettier

112
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.590
and it just puts it in there for me

113
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.540
that's nothing to do with how it works.

114
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.230
Lets from handlers.js

115
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.970
what else you got for me?

116
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.030
Here we go.

117
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.120
Reference error convert is not defined

118
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.500
that's happening in hanlers.js line two.

119
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.303
Go into handlers.js okay.

120
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.463
So, Import.

121
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.823
Convert

122
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.433
from

123
00:05:41.355 --> 00:05:42.188
lib

124
00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:49.530
refactor lib, oh lib.j,

125
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.260
I keep forgetting to put js at the end

126
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.720
that's because the bundeler which I do all my coding in

127
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.653
doesn't need it.

128
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.773
What's next?

129
00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.256
From input. Okay so from input to select to

130
00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:01.140
to El

131
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.880
format currency. Lets get that out of the way.

132
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.300
Import

133
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.010
format currency from

134
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.340
that is from utils.js

135
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.270
All right, so all of these elements

136
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.100
now need to be selected

137
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.350
and rather than pass them in

138
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.520
ill put them in their own module I think

139
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.330
so lets make a new file called elements.js

140
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.030
and I believe we just these ones

141
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.430
cut and paste them in here.

142
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.160
Oh, one other thing that people might often do

143
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.100
is instead of just using

144
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.390
document.querySelector for all of these,

145
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.910
they will pass in

146
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.440
an app

147
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.273
instance,

148
00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:50.000
much like we did with the gallery

149
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.890
like this,

150
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.420
and then look inside that for all of these things.

151
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.116
So you would have app.querySelector

152
00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:57.770
app.querySelector for each of these.

153
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.760
So, and that allows you to have multiple on the same page,

154
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.450
just like we did with our slider

155
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.060
and our gallery.

156
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.310
For this I think its fine

157
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.430
so export those

158
00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:13.076
and from select is not defined

159
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.050
so we import from input, from select

160
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.053
to select and to El.

161
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.120
Import those

162
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.180
that comes from

163
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.510
elements.js

164
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.810
from select is not defined in money.js

165
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.010
Okay. Oh so we also need from select and to select

166
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.470
on page load

167
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.920
so we import them again

168
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.320
that's the beauty of modules

169
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.810
if you need them in multiple files,

170
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.883
you can import them into multiple files.

171
00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.930
Elements.js

172
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.260
All right, there we go.

173
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.840
Rates by base. I think this is going to be the tuff one.

174
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.390
So end point and rates by base.

175
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.600
They need to go into our endpoint.

176
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.270
Yeah they need to go into our lib.js

177
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.320
so we just take this out

178
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.360
and go into our lib.js

179
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.830
paste them at the top

180
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.420
and, oh! This is actually not

181
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.240
not as hard as I thought it would be

182
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.460
I think it just works!

183
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.623
Should we try it?

184
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.200
So CAD

185
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.986
it just works! Okay.

186
00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:42.520
(laughs) I thought that was going to be harder

187
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.810
because we were updating a variable,

188
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.940
but then, the beauty of modules scope

189
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.500
is that inside of this module,

190
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.050
I can't create this rates by base object

191
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.450
and then we update it from within one of these functions.

192
00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:01.030
And even though we're calling the convert from another file,

193
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.080
it still knows about the scope of this file

194
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.590
much like a scope of a closure would be.

195
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.520
And we can access it no problem,

196
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.960
and that the beauty of

197
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.980
you don't have to pass it in or anything like that

198
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.260
you just reach for it on there.

199
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.770
The only gotcha about these modules is,

200
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.640
if you're on the server,

201
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.730
this will be shared by every request that comes in,

202
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.630
which may or may not be what you want.

203
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.240
I certainly have had oopsies on the server before

204
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.360
where I was storing data in here

205
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.760
and it was being overwritten by multiple users

206
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.750
and if that's the case,

207
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.670
you have to get into a sign called sessions,

208
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.330
or scope that to each function,

209
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.640
but in our case, and in most cases,

210
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.080
I would say this is absolutely fine.

211
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.310
So, that is how I converted it

212
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.640
we got a whole bunch of different files

213
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.033
all of them seem pretty manageable.

214
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.380
And that's it.

215
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.000
Well actually one more thing is

216
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.430
you might even

217
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.540
take this

218
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.570
and you might put this into a like a boot strap

219
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.840
or an app init function

220
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.250
and what do I mean by that,

221
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.050
well, you might go and

222
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.310
take all of this,

223
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.660
all of this happens when the page loads

224
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.080
this code runs

225
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.770
and that is fine,

226
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.030
but sometimes you want to delay running

227
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.010
of what happens on page load

228
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.020
and if that the case,

229
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.550
then what I would do is

230
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.940
I would just take all of it

231
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.040
and go into my lib

232
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.190
and ill make another

233
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.023
function

234
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.130
called init

235
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.120
or bootstrap

236
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.030
or start or something like that

237
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.000
or go

238
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.620
and then paste all that code in there

239
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:55.720
and then we have to import the select and to select so

240
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.230
we'll go to the top here

241
00:10:59.070 --> 00:10:59.903
import

242
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.320
from select to select from

243
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.073
elements

244
00:11:09.487 --> 00:11:10.320
.js

245
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.070
and then we go

246
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:14.903
and now

247
00:11:14.903 --> 00:11:16.170
like nothing works,

248
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.080
there's nothing here,

249
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.790
the app has not started.

250
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.540
And then what you can do is

251
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.120
just like start the app.

252
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.896
And we just import

253
00:11:25.896 --> 00:11:26.729
init

254
00:11:26.729 --> 00:11:27.562
from

255
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.540
the lib folder

256
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.140
file

257
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.389
and then just start it.

258
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:35.222
Init.

259
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.300
Now we got one more error here

260
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.353
generate options is not defined.

261
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.360
That is in lib.js

262
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.253
so go here,

263
00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.973
okay and,

264
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.620
to do that we just import it

265
00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.550
do you see how you

266
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.810
always have to import if in the file that you need it

267
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.313
so generate options from, that is from utils.

268
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.680
Currencies, we also need currencies

269
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.170
so actually we can probably just take

270
00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.573
this

271
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.230
yeah we need all three of these

272
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.920
we need to just move over

273
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:28.503
to

274
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.750
our lib js

275
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.940
and now its giving me grief

276
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.640
about this one

277
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.230
dependency cycle

278
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.720
detected

279
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.300
oh I think its whining at me because

280
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:50.100
our handlers includes, requires convert

281
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.370
from there

282
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.203
and then

283
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.880
our handle input requires lib

284
00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.870
so they require each other

285
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.680
and I guess you could end up,

286
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.580
the app works fine,

287
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.840
but I guess you could end up in the situation where

288
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.180
they require each other and then forever

289
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.080
and then nothing just spins out of control.

290
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.680
So if that's the case,

291
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.590
maybe here, lets do one more.

292
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.610
One more file.

293
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.540
Lets call in init.js

294
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.980
And then just stick all of that

295
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.150
in the init js

296
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.530
so take that out,

297
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:26.623
put it in here,

298
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.860
then we'll grab

299
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.200
all of these,

300
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.693
and paste that at the top.

301
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.050
Then we'll go back to our money js

302
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.980
and we'll import init form init js

303
00:13:43.814 --> 00:13:47.260
there we go, everything is working just fine.

304
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.090
You could even go one step further

305
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.830
and not run this code until somebody clicks a button

306
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.460
or even hovers over it

307
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.450
we could just select the app.

308
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.810
So what does this thing have on it?

309
00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:00.870
Div with a class of app

310
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.380
so, document

311
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.680
dot query selector

312
00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:06.493
app

313
00:14:08.162 --> 00:14:10.890
and we'll say app dot add event listener

314
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.190
we'll mouse enter

315
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.330
and when that happens,

316
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.880
we'll run init.

317
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.110
And we will tell that

318
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.180
once is true

319
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.920
so we don't initialize it once every time someone mouses in.

320
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.753
So there we go.

321
00:14:26.753 --> 00:14:29.783
See look how select currency and as soon as I mouse in

322
00:14:29.783 --> 00:14:32.840
boom! That app initialized and

323
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.280
it populated all those values for us

324
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.810
and it looks like it still works great.

325
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.655
So that another way to do it.

326
00:14:43.655 --> 00:14:46.310
You can start getting splitting hairs

327
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:47.940
I guess we don't need this as well,

328
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.340
you can start splitting stuff like crazy

329
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.650
because all we've really done here

330
00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.080
is now our entry point

331
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.300
has almost nothing in it

332
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.010
and we've just put it in a separate file.

333
00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.380
Is that okay? Absolutely.

334
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.630
Some people like their entry point

335
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.250
just have a very little code.

336
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.920
You could have certainly just put all of this code

337
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.170
in your money day js as well.

338
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.130
So, hopefully you learned a thing or two there.

339
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.163
Lets get into using bundelers.
