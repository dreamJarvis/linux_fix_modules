<v ->Hey!</v>

4
00:00:07.103 --> 00:00:07.936
Wes Bos here, thank you so much

5
00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:09.440
for checking out Beginner JavaScript.

6
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.100
This course is gonna give you a rock-solid understanding

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.000
of the JavaScript fundamentals.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.690
See a lot of new developers getting into JavaScript

9
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.080
and they're frustrated with the complexity and the pace

10
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.910
at which frameworks and libraries move,

11
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.170
and then the reality is is that a lot of them don't have

12
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.930
or they're missing the fundamentals,

13
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.480
a good set of core fundamental JavaScript.

14
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.240
Frameworks change, languages change, libraries change,

15
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.990
even your job is gonna change,

16
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.947
and having a good set of fundamentals,

17
00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:38.310
being comfortable with the language,

18
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.160
is going to allow you to roll into those

19
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.950
and pick those things out much more quickly.

20
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.090
So, that's what this course is.

21
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.923
I hope you enjoy it.

22
00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:45.160
Thanks for checking it out.
