(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Instructor>All right, in the next two videos we are</v>

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.840
going to refactor our gallery and our slider exercises

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.240
that we did earlier to take advantage of the prototype.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.510
So let's open up gallery and open up gallery.js.

6
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.550
I want you just to take a copy of that and

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.693
save it as gallery-prototype.

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.760
And then go into your index.html of your gallery

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.123
and change it to gallery-prototype.

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.480
Now there's a couple things that need to happen here.

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.610
First of all, let's just scroll all the way to the

12
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.000
bottom here and see that we have gallery1 and gallery2.

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.670
If I were to console.log gallery1 and gallery2,

14
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.343
let's just see what we're working with here.

15
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.900
We get undefined and undefined.

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.733
Now why is that?

17
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:56.200
Well, because this function doesn't actually return

18
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.520
anything from it, but if we change it to use a new

19
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.670
keyword, it'll automatically return an instance

20
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.150
of that gallery.

21
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.750
You can see there's nothing in it,

22
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.650
and there's nothing on the prototype of that.

23
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.320
So there's not much to do here,

24
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.390
but we're gonna see as we start adding things

25
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.940
to the prototype and to the instance,

26
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.563
we'll see them populate there.

27
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.350
So first thing I'm gonna do is go all the way

28
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.270
to the top here,

29
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.950
and we'll sorta go line by line.

30
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.262
This checking of the gallery is totally fine.

31
00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:32.990
The only thing that we need to do now is to

32
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.910
save reference to the gallery div that was passed in

33
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.210
because we're going to need it in our prototype

34
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.410
methods in just a second.

35
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.970
So what we can do is say this.gallery is equal to

36
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.810
the gallery that was passed in.

37
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.470
Now when I refresh it,

38
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.130
and, oh it took my console logs out.

39
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.023
Let me keep that.

40
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.510
You see we have both of our galleries

41
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.280
and you can see that these are instance properties

42
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.800
because they're different in each one.

43
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.990
Okay now we need to go through all of these

44
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.120
variables that we created right here.

45
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.680
We just created them as variables inside of this

46
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.600
closure, but because we're gonna be moving

47
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.413
all of these open, close, handleClickOutside,

48
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.370
all of these methods are gonna be moved to the

49
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.050
prototype, they no longer will have access to

50
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.180
this closure.

51
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.640
Meaning that we need to surface these variables on

52
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.250
our instance somehow.

53
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.870
And the way that you can surface a variable

54
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.500
on an instance is simply saying this dot the name.

55
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.490
So we're gonna change all of these variables

56
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.380
in everywhere we've used them to this.images,

57
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.420
this.modal.

58
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.380
Now the easiest way I've found to do that is,

59
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.860
instead of trying to hunt them down,

60
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.230
just right click and we wanna say Rename Symbol,

61
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.890
and we wanna change it to this.images.

62
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.110
And then you remove the const because we're no longer

63
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.360
declaring a variable.

64
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.890
We're simply setting a property on the gallery instance.

65
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.400
So I give that a save.

66
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.100
And just go through the rest of them.

67
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.823
Rename, this dot, remove the const.

68
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.673
Rename.

69
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.090
Rename the symbol.

70
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.933
This dot, remove the const.

71
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.513
Right click, Rename.

72
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.560
This dot, remove the const.

73
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.280
We don't need the currentImage any longer

74
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.230
and that's because where ever we set the currentImage...

75
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.090
Where is currentImage?

76
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.750
Here we go, right here.

77
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.290
We will simply say this.currentImage equals element.

78
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.140
We're going to be able to put it on the instance.

79
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.560
So that's what we do there.

80
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.523
So delete the let currentImage.

81
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.130
Now if I refresh this, you'll see that each of our instances

82
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.890
now have these properties inside of them.

83
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.830
We've got our buttons, we've got our images,

84
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.130
and we have our gallery.

85
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.020
Then the rest of these functions are going to be shared

86
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.840
amongst each of the galleries by moving them

87
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.940
to the prototype.

88
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.380
So I'm gonna just select all of them

89
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.550
and move them out.

90
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.993
So openModal, closeModal, handleClickOutside,

91
00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:18.680
handleKeyUp, showNextImage, showPrevImage, showImage,

92
00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:23.770
and that's it.

93
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.480
You keep you event listeners in there.

94
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.080
We'll go over those in just a second.

95
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.360
So I'm gonna cut them outta here.

96
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.900
And I'm gonna go below where we've defined our gallery.

97
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.330
So this is our function gallery, open,

98
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.140
close, and then we'll go right below that

99
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.530
and paste them in.

100
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.260
Now what we need to do is,

101
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.460
we need to change each one of these functions

102
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.020
to now be on the prototype of the gallery.

103
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.320
So we're gonna remove the word function.

104
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.917
We'll say capital G, Gallery.prototype.openModal

105
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.550
is equal to a function,

106
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.270
and we give that a save and a refresh.

107
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.570
And now you'll see in your prototype of the gallery,

108
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.990
we now have access to this openModal.

109
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.270
Nothing will work yet 'cause it's all broken,

110
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.030
but we'll go through these one by one

111
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.820
and fix them all.

112
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.020
So now I won't make you do them all like this.

113
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.070
What I like to say is,

114
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.770
hold down click, hold down Command,

115
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.050
and then just put a cursor in front of every

116
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.283
single one of these.

117
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.570
And then I'm gonna hit Command + Shift + Left Arrow.

118
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.810
I think that's Control + Shift + Left Arrow on Windows.

119
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.643
And we'll say

120
00:05:38.643 --> 00:05:42.647
capital G, Gallery.prototype.handleClickOutside,

121
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.530
now I'm gonna hit my Alt key and hit my Right Arrow

122
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.620
to jump to the end of the function,

123
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.454
and we'll set that to be equal to function.

124
00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.483
There we go.

125
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.830
So now I've just renamed all of my functions to

126
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.330
be Gallery.prototype the name of the function

127
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.540
and that is equal to a function there.

128
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.103
Now it won't even load.

129
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.350
And that's okay because we get these errors

130
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.810
handleClickOutside is not defined.

131
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.263
If we go to line 29,

132
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.860
you're gonna see all of these.

133
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.240
Any time we reference one of our functions,

134
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.220
it now needs to be changed to

135
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.353
this.showImage.

136
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.950
And this is where ESLint becomes really helpful.

137
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.300
If I click on ESLint in the bottom here,

138
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.410
go to my problems,

139
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.700
you can see these are all of my problems.

140
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.780
They are not defined.

141
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.760
So I can just go one by one

142
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.050
and change them out,

143
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.023
this dot,

144
00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:45.620
handleClickOutside,

145
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.840
this dot.

146
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.300
So anywhere you had a function from before,

147
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.540
it now needs to be changed to this dot.

148
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.890
So I'll just zoom out.

149
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.480
I'll just zoom through this really quickly.

150
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.803
You can do it as well.

151
00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:02.817
♪ I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over ♪

152
00:07:03.557 --> 00:07:05.853
♪ Will it be yes or will it be ♪

153
00:07:05.853 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Instructor>All right, so I went through all of my</v>

154
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.210
ESLint problems.

155
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.780
It's still telling me I've got lots of spelling mistakes,

156
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.980
but that's totally fine.

157
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.560
We'll close that up.

158
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.760
Now that I have converted everything to a prototype,

159
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.470
all of my variables and all of my methods

160
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.500
are now referenceable by this dot their old name.

161
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.830
Let's go through the app and try

162
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.640
and sort of go through any issues that we now have.

163
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.350
So open up the gallery.

164
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.320
There it is.

165
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.450
If I click on one of these,

166
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.880
that seems to work just fine.

167
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.490
I'm going to click the buttons.

168
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.980
That is our first error.

169
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.850
Let's see what else.

170
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.200
We'll make a little laundry list here.

171
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.903
So clicking next/prev buttons is broke.

172
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.663
Now if I click outside, that's broken.

173
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.193
And if I hit Escape, that is also broken.

174
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.980
And I believe that is all the problems that we have

175
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:06.843
right now.

176
00:08:06.843 --> 00:08:07.676
So let's go through those.

177
00:08:07.676 --> 00:08:09.530
Clicking next/prev buttons is broken.

178
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.540
So open it up,

179
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.750
click Next.

180
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.713
The error says,

181
00:08:15.165 --> 00:08:18.710
cannot read property nextElementSibling of undefined

182
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.890
on line 69.

183
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.520
Okay, let's do it.

184
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.640
69...

185
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.320
Cannot read property, nextElementSibling of undefined.

186
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.470
So what that's telling me is that

187
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.540
this.currentImage is undefined.

188
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.590
So my question is,

189
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.260
what is this?

190
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.600
Let's try.

191
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.550
Go here,

192
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.360
console.log this.

193
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.160
So now when I open it up,

194
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.090
this as far as we know,

195
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.053
this should always equal the instance of the gallery, right?

196
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.570
Button?

197
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.513
Why is this equal to a button?

198
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.100
Okay, let's figure out where showNextImage being

199
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.040
called from.

200
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.490
Not from, this is, this is for we use our keyboard.

201
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.860
We're clicking right now.

202
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.310
So let's find out where else.

203
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:14.120
There we go, showNextImage is being used right here.

204
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.960
To remove the event listener,

205
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.790
oh also, it's being used to,

206
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.260
here we go addEventListener.

207
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.610
So what's happening here is that

208
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.150
we are listening for a click

209
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.660
and then when that click happens,

210
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.080
the showNextImage function is running.

211
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.850
But what did I tell you about passing call backs

212
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.670
to addEventListener and the keyword this?

213
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.600
Whenever you pass a call back to an EventListener,

214
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.920
this keyword will be equal to the thing that

215
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.170
is to the left of the dot.

216
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.436
So does it make sense that the next button

217
00:09:48.436 --> 00:09:50.120
is to the left?

218
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.242
And when we log this it's equal to it?

219
00:09:53.242 --> 00:09:55.576
It should, somewhat.

220
00:09:55.576 --> 00:09:57.832
(laughs)

221
00:09:57.832 --> 00:09:59.720
The question is how do we fix that.

222
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.570
Because that's just how functions work.

223
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.520
Well, there's a couple ways you can sorta get around it.

224
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.800
I'll show you a couple ways.

225
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.560
First way, and this is pretty popular

226
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.340
in React world.

227
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.560
And that is just to pass an arrow function instead.

228
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.870
And what that will do is,

229
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.500
instead of passing the function directly,

230
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.682
we pass it a new function that will in turn

231
00:10:23.682 --> 00:10:27.610
call showNextImage for us.

232
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.343
And watch what happens now.

233
00:10:29.343 --> 00:10:30.870
Here I go.

234
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.690
Now that works.

235
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.660
But let me show you the problem with that.

236
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.040
And for that to work,

237
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.730
we also need to get our Escape working.

238
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.570
So let's do this.

239
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.000
handleKeyUp, let's do the same thing

240
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.840
except in this case handleKeyUp needs the event.

241
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.593
So we just have to hot potato the event from that function

242
00:10:50.593 --> 00:10:52.170
to another.

243
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.067
Now let me show you the problem.

244
00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:54.197
You open it up,

245
00:10:54.197 --> 00:10:55.900
and I hit my Escape key.

246
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.770
And I open it up again,

247
00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.870
hit my Escape key.

248
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.130
Open it up again,

249
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.843
and now when I click right,

250
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.093
whoa.

251
00:11:05.786 --> 00:11:07.640
Okay, it's going from hoodie

252
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.150
to backpack.

253
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.090
It skipped two?

254
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.253
I'll close it down.

255
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.630
Let's go back to hoodie.

256
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.200
Now we'll go to backpack again.

257
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.423
Suitcase?

258
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.563
Open it again.

259
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.283
Jacket?

260
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.390
Every time I close it,

261
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.970
it's going one further.

262
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.240
Is it gonna go to shoes this time?

263
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.300
Oh my gosh, it is.

264
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.850
You see what's happening

265
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.470
is that,

266
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.173
let me go back to the showNextImage function here.

267
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.503
And let's just say console.log showing next image.

268
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.390
Clear this out, open it up.

269
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.550
Close it down, open it up.

270
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.690
Close it down, open it up.

271
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:52.870
Close it down, open it up.

272
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.420
Close it down, and I'll clear it.

273
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.120
And clear it one more time.

274
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.223
Now I'm gonna hit it.

275
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.260
Showing next image,

276
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.560
showing next image,

277
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.590
showing next image.

278
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.400
See what's happening here is that

279
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.410
every time that we open it up,

280
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.490
we're binding another,

281
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:15.490
we're listening for another click of it right here.

282
00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.360
And the way we fixed that before is that we just

283
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.360
removed the event listener when we closed the modal.

284
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.940
And that way we added and removed it

285
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.180
every time we opened and closed it.

286
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.210
But what happens when you do this

287
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.500
is that you're creating another function

288
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.820
and in order to remove an event listener,

289
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.530
you have to have reference to that function.

290
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.470
So that's kind of annoying.

291
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.040
So the other way that we can sort of fix that

292
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.660
is by binding it to this

293
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.740
when we have access to this.

294
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.350
And that is inside of the gallery.

295
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.840
So it'll get a little bit complicated.

296
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.860
Don't sweat it if it doesn't make sense the first time.

297
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.700
This honestly took me a couple years to get it.

298
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.690
So stay with me, keep going through the exercises,

299
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.480
and this will make sense after,

300
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.580
I don't know, maybe the seventh time, eighth time

301
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.460
that you build something this way.

302
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.460
But this is a pretty common thing that happens

303
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.880
in React world.

304
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.370
And what we'll do is right here we'll say

305
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:23.210
bind our methods to the instance when we need them.

306
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.400
So we'll say this dot...

307
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.950
What was the ones that we were having trouble with?

308
00:13:36.329 --> 00:13:40.050
showNextImage, handleKeyUp, and showPreviousImage.

309
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.700
So this.showNextImage is equal to

310
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.700
this.showNextImage.bind(this).

311
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.610
So what happened there?

312
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.950
Well, what we're doing is we're creating an instance

313
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.630
property of the same prototype function

314
00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.380
but bound with this.

315
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.120
So what does this bind do?

316
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.870
Bind allows us to explicitly supply what this

317
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.140
will be equal to.

318
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.950
And because in our constructor this is equal to

319
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.870
the instance, we are creating a new function

320
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.520
that has this bound to it.

321
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.220
Then what that allows us to do

322
00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.300
is where we go find or showNextImage,

323
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.287
we can now just simply pass showNextImage

324
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.700
without having to worry about any of that.

325
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.670
Click it.

326
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.570
Next, next, next.

327
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.460
It's working just fine.

328
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.500
Our previous isn't gonna work 'cause we haven't done it

329
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.600
there just yet.

330
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.880
Now the benefit of doing that over,

331
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.387
sometimes you might see people do this as well,

332
00:14:49.387 --> 00:14:50.220
.bind(this).

333
00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.280
And they'll do it right at the time,

334
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.550
is that we, by binding it here,

335
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.940
we lose reference to the new function

336
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.220
that was created.

337
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.170
And that stops us from being able to remove

338
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.300
that event listener in the future.

339
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.000
So you always need to hold onto your functions

340
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.160
when you create them

341
00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.220
so that you can remove them in the future.

342
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.950
And by doing this,

343
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:13.960
we've lost it.

344
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.420
So we are saving reference to it

345
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.430
inside of our constructor.

346
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.940
So let's go ahead and duplicate that

347
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.720
and make it the showPrevImage.

348
00:15:30.158 --> 00:15:31.830
So does that work?

349
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.300
Back, back, back works.

350
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.940
Okay.

351
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.470
Does my Escape key work?

352
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.100
Escape key is working.

353
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.010
Oh, but that's because we're passing

354
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.670
the E,

355
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.830
so we don't wanna do that.

356
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.338
Let's change that back to handleKeyUp.

357
00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:49.570
You don't have to pass that

358
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.630
because we are removing it here, right?

359
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.010
So we need to go back up here

360
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:59.010
and say this.handleKeyUp is equal to this.handleKeyUp.

361
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.460
And I believe the last one is

362
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.870
the click outside.

363
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.970
Yeah, that's still the same problem as well.

364
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:11.970
So if we do this.handleClickOutside is equal to bind.

365
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.240
This is why a lot of people don't like this

366
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.160
method of doing it.

367
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.910
People much prefer just having a bunch of functions

368
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.040
and that is totally fine.

369
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.040
'Cause this is a bit of a pain having to figure

370
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.870
out what does this equal in each context

371
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.710
and it changes depending on what the function is

372
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.350
and it's not as explicit as just having a bunch

373
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.190
of functions are.

374
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.061
And if you feel that way,

375
00:16:33.061 --> 00:16:35.130
I often feel that way myself,

376
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.109
then it may mean that this whole prototype

377
00:16:38.109 --> 00:16:40.310
way of coding is not for you.

378
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:45.310
And there's certainly lots of people who think that way.

379
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.840
So I teach you all the ways

380
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.310
just because this is probably something

381
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.610
that will come up in an interview.

382
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.690
And there are lots of programmers who think

383
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.840
this is the best way to structure your apps.

384
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.210
Click it, there we go.

385
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.750
Now everything is working beautifully.

386
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.360
So we have our gallery.

387
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.220
We've got our instance properties.

388
00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.930
We have our binding of our methods that need to have

389
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.158
access to this.

390
00:17:09.158 --> 00:17:11.710
Then we have our images.

391
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.670
The reason why we don't remove the event listeners

392
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.090
is 'cause this only happens once

393
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.733
on page load when the gallery is created.

394
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.630
And then we have all of our prototypal methods

395
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.060
down below.

396
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.800
All right, so that is the gallery.

397
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.030
Maybe try and do the slider one yourself.

398
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.910
If not, I'll meet you in the next video.

399
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.780
We'll learn how to do that with prototypes.

400
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.560
And then we'll learn a little bit about classes

401
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.513
and do one final refactor for this app.
