00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.290
(upbeat hip hop music)

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.550
<v Tutor>So far, everything we've been learning</v>

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.090
has been just JavaScript as part of the core language,

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.080
and while JavaScript

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.010
can be run in many types of environment,

6
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.880
so it can be run in the browser,

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.550
it can be run on the server,

8
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.400
you can run it on robots.

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.900
Um, a lot of places use JavaScript

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.060
as a scripting environment,

11
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.230
in fact my kid has some toys

12
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.070
and if you want to be able to script the toy,

13
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.930
you can run it in JavaScript.

14
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.910
Um probably the most popular and probably the way

15
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.090
that most people get introduced to JavaScript

16
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.530
is through the web browser.

17
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.900
Uh the web browser,

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.550
the web browser (laughs).

19
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.460
Uh a big part of working with JavaScript in the web browser

20
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.340
is interacting with elements on a page.

21
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.760
So when you write html and view it in the browser,

22
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.720
the browser turns your html into something that is called

23
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.350
the Document Object Model or the DOM,

24
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.120
and that's actually exactly what you see

25
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.930
when you go to the elements panel on absolutely any website.

26
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.140
So once we have all of our html

27
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.060
and it's been turned into the DOM,

28
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.250
is again what you see here in the elements panel

29
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.300
is, is not actually just the html that you've written,

30
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.420
it actually takes that,

31
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.010
converts it into the Document Object Model,

32
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.720
I'm gonna call it the DOM for the rest of this course,

33
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.930
um and it allows us to interface with the DOM via JavaScript

34
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.820
and we can do things

35
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.250
like we can listen for clicks and scrolls,

36
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.210
uh we can add,

37
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.560
remove or modify elements to that page,

38
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.709
things like text and images et cetera,

39
00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.720
we can add or remove classes to elements

40
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.240
that can trigger CSS animations,

41
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.790
we can fetch new data,

42
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.050
uh we can play music and video

43
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.390
and we can add any type of interaction to the page,

44
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.750
and that is done by writing JavaScript

45
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.470
that interfaces with the DOM,

46
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.150
again the DOM is the things that are on the page,

47
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.450
the elements on the page.

48
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.010
So,

49
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.170
the DOM is represented in a tree

50
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.100
that looks very much like html,

51
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.590
and that's kinda why it's probably familiar to you,

52
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.189
seeing it in the elements panel here.

53
00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.400
Um even if you plan on using a framework like React,

54
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.233
or Angular,

55
00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:08.540
or, um,

56
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.373
View,

57
00:02:09.373 --> 00:02:13.070
or whatever the framework of choice is at the moment,

58
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.980
um, it's very, very helpful

59
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.210
to understand the concepts of the DOM

60
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.310
because the core concepts of the DOM,

61
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.560
like events and elements and classes,

62
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.810
they transcend all of the different frameworks

63
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.600
even if the frameworks help you,

64
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.370
help you do these things,

65
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.540
um, you still have to understand

66
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.120
how they work under the hood,

67
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.800
as well as I feel like when you're learning JavaScript

68
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.616
and you are building actual things that you can click,

69
00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:39.220
and hover and add elements,

70
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.110
and remove elements,

71
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.680
I feel like you can learn a lot better

72
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.760
than just doing most of the stuff we've done so far,

73
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.470
which is looping over stuff,

74
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.410
and console logging

75
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.500
and creating functions.

76
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.350
So, let's have a quick, quick refresher on the window.

77
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.730
I remember we talked about in the scope,

78
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.480
we learned about the global scope in the browser

79
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.900
is called the window,

80
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.733
um and the window

81
00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:03.790
is where all of our global variables are stored

82
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.389
as well as helpful properties like,

83
00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.560
there's actually like Window.Location

84
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.573
if you go into any website and type in a Window.Location,

85
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.720
or if you just type in a location,

86
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.910
that's the same thing,

87
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.610
because window is a global variable.

88
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.480
It's either a global variable or a property on window,

89
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.770
they're the same thing.

90
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.510
Um, you can open that up and there's just this object

91
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.880
that's full of information

92
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.270
about what the current page you're on,

93
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.570
what the host name is,

94
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.680
what the protocol is if we we're on a specific port,

95
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.003
um it would be showing us that info.

96
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.883
We can either find...,

97
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.140
also find things like, like

98
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.210
innerWidth that'll tell you how wide the actual browser is,

99
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.110
if I make that sucker a little bit bigger

100
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.943
and check it again,

101
00:03:44.943 --> 00:03:46.890
it will tell us the width and the height rate,

102
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.480
those are global variables.

103
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.080
You can think of the window

104
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.830
as everything about the currently open window,

105
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.000
including the browser bar,

106
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.870
the tabs,

107
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.840
the scrollbars,

108
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.360
all of the stuff about your actual browser window,

109
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.430
is generally stored inside of the window object.

110
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.570
Now we're going to introduce you to another thing

111
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.100
which is called the document,

112
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.850
and the document is responsible for everything

113
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.300
from the opening html tag,

114
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.730
actually (laughs) the doc type as well,

115
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.620
to the closing html tag.

116
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.980
So um again,

117
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.090
the document is not concerned with tabs,

118
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.210
and outside and stuff like that,

119
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.420
it's just concerned with the actual entire DOM,

120
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.370
or the entire,

121
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.590
that's why it's called the DOM,

122
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.070
the Document Object Model,

123
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.400
so the entire document is gonna be accessible to us

124
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.000
via the document key word.

125
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.833
It's actually,

126
00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:39.666
if you type it in,

127
00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:41.500
and you hover over what it returns,

128
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.653
you'll see that it highlights the entire page.

129
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.550
We additionally have something called the navigator,

130
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.790
and the navigator is just sort of a higher level

131
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.840
um thing than the window that gives you information about,

132
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.340
not just the browser,

133
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.900
but the device itself,

134
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.300
the device that it's on.

135
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.240
So think about things like,

136
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.180
webcam and audio access,

137
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.260
and battery level,

138
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.317
GPS coordinates,

139
00:05:06.317 --> 00:05:08.980
um things that are sort of device specific

140
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.900
will live on the navigator,

141
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.910
we'll look at some examples to go there.

142
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.947
But right now we just need to know that,

143
00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:16.450
we had window,

144
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.230
which contains a lot of information about the browser,

145
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.390
but the document doc is going to contain everything

146
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.450
about the current web page,

147
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.340
from the opening html to the closing html tag.

148
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.240
So with that,

149
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.120
let's get jumping into selecting elements on the page.
