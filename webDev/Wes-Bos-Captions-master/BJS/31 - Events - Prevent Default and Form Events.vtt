1
00:00:00.771 --> 00:00:03.354
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.480
<v ->All right, now we're going to dive into</v>

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.600
one more method that you'll probably use

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.480
all the time,

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.130
and that's the "prevent default" method

6
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.280
on your event.

7
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.910
As well as we're going to dive into

8
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.050
working with forms,

9
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:15.883
and stuff like that.

10
00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:17.410
Because this is pretty common stuff

11
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.860
that you're going to be doing,

12
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.150
along with clicks and hovers and stuff like that.

13
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.050
A lot of your time working with events

14
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.510
will probably be surrounded in your forms and inputs

15
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.400
and things like that.

16
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.430
So we have this forms JS and R29 events folder,

17
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.880
as well as forms JS,

18
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.760
which should be empty,

19
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.780
you can close...

20
00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:42.070
You can close everything down there.

21
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.570
Let's just console.log "IT WORKS"

22
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.403
Make sure

23
00:00:45.403 --> 00:00:46.236
it works.

24
00:00:46.236 --> 00:00:47.069
Let's see.

25
00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:48.420
It works, okay cool.

26
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.320
So let's first talk about Prevent Default.

27
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.580
Now there's a couple

28
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.570
elements

29
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.021
in HTML

30
00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.829
that have default functionality

31
00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.410
when they're clicked

32
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.840
or when they're used.

33
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.650
So if you think of something,

34
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.570
like maybe let's just put a link in there.

35
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.960
And if we were to go to

36
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.100
wesbos.com

37
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.190
Wes Bos

38
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.280
Now if I were to go ahead and click on that,

39
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.160
obviously it brings me to

40
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.420
wesbos.com, right?

41
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.420
That's not that big of a surprise.

42
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.690
However, what you can do is you can

43
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.820
stop the default action

44
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.130
of the browser,

45
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.870
if you want to then pick it up from

46
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.703
from JavaScript.

47
00:01:31.703 --> 00:01:33.247
So we can maybe give that a class,

48
00:01:33.247 --> 00:01:34.080
"wes,"

49
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.800
You go in here and select it.

50
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.840
And we can listen for a click on "wes."

51
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.040
So "wes.addEventListener"

52
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.670
listen for a click,

53
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.550
and when that runs,

54
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.693
we'll run a function,

55
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.450
which has our event,

56
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.450
and then inside there we'll log our event.

57
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.710
Now watch this.

58
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.800
Ready?

59
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.030
Click it.

60
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.770
For a split second you see the event there,

61
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.330
and then everything is gone, because I've changed over

62
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.590
to my website.

63
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.900
If that ever happens to you,

64
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.880
this is sort of an aside,

65
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.310
if that ever happens to you where

66
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.680
you're trying to log something,

67
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.050
but it changes really quickly,

68
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.941
you can click on the little "cog" icon,

69
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:09.820
and click on "preserve log."

70
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.270
And what that will do is

71
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.040
you can log something,

72
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.157
and then it will say

73
00:02:14.157 --> 00:02:15.670
"You changed the page."

74
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.840
and then go ahead and

75
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.370
have any JavaScript errors or warnings.

76
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.943
Looks like there's a whole bunch going on here.

77
00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:23.776
(laughs)

78
00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:24.609
Holy smokes!

79
00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.190
For that specific website.

80
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.080
And then if you go back,

81
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.720
it will tell you "You navigated back."

82
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.250
So sometimes you need to turn that on

83
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.470
if the console logs are disappearing quicker,

84
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.520
then I can.

85
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.856
So that's the

86
00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.420
default of a link is to change the page,

87
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.260
however, if you call event.preventDefault,

88
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.090
what that will do is it will prevent

89
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.350
the default thing of that element

90
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.260
from happening.

91
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.320
In our case, the link is going to change.

92
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.430
So now, if I go to it,

93
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.920
and I click on this link,

94
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.330
(mouse clicking)

95
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.180
nothing happens because the default of a link is to change,

96
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.913
so what we can do in that case is we could console.log.

97
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.703
You clicked it.

98
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.530
We could console.log...

99
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.520
I'll give you an example where this might be helpful.

100
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.150
So go to it,

101
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.130
you clicked it,

102
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.040
and maybe you want to ask the user for

103
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.070
some specific information before they

104
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.140
changed to that thing.

105
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.580
So you could,

106
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.830
and I know I've told you not to use prompt,

107
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.550
but this is one case you would use prompt,

108
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.350
you say "const should change page"

109
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.740
is equal to "prompt

110
00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:37.943
"This website might be malicious.

111
00:03:39.647 --> 00:03:41.527
"Do you wish to

112
00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:43.077
"proceed?"

113
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.530
So now what happens is,

114
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.030
actually maybe we'll console.log that.

115
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.637
Console.log

116
00:03:50.637 --> 00:03:52.610
"Should change page."

117
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.700
So now I click on it.

118
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.350
It says "This website might be --"

119
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.090
Oh it's not "prompt" it's "confirm!"

120
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.923
I don't care about...

121
00:03:58.923 --> 00:04:00.338
(laughs)

122
00:04:00.338 --> 00:04:02.530
If you type in "Yes, sure" into there,

123
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.890
no of course that's not what we want to do.

124
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.106
We want to use "confirm."

125
00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:08.517
Now let's go ahead and try it.

126
00:04:08.517 --> 00:04:10.250
"May be malicious. Do you wish to proceed?"

127
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.010
You can "cancel" or "okay."

128
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.637
And that will either give you a true

129
00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:15.237
or a false.

130
00:04:15.237 --> 00:04:16.220
Actually what we can do,

131
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.750
is we move the "preventDefault" to the top,

132
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.857
and then we can say

133
00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:21.690
"if

134
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.937
should change page,"

135
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.310
then

136
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.577
we will say "window

137
00:04:31.577 --> 00:04:33.160
.location

138
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.000
is equal to

139
00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:36.917
"event.currentTarget

140
00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:39.140
.href" or H ref

141
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.483
Because that will give us the URL.

142
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.000
And watch this.

143
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.833
There.

144
00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:45.666
Cancel.

145
00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:46.499
Goes nowhere.

146
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.290
Click "okay" it will actually change the page for us.

147
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.440
Another way that we could do that is we could

148
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.880
simply

149
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.190
move this preventDefault

150
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.083
into here.

151
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.183
And say

152
00:05:00.487 --> 00:05:04.270
"if we should NOT change page."

153
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.150
So "should change page" will be true.

154
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.200
So if we should not change the page,

155
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.920
then we'll just prevent the default.

156
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.070
In that case you don't have to mess with window.location,

157
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.144
or anything like that.

158
00:05:13.144 --> 00:05:15.510
So now if we click on it.

159
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.400
Cancel.

160
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.990
It prevents default.

161
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.350
Okay, it does nothing,

162
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.330
and we continue to change the page.

163
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.170
So preventing default is extremely handy for when you wish

164
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.830
to stop the default thing from happening.

165
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.080
So what other sort-of defaults are there

166
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.190
on a page?

167
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.230
Probably another common one that I specifically use is

168
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.390
submitting a form element.

169
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.530
So we could go into our form here,

170
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.020
and give our form a...

171
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.657
Let's give it a name.

172
00:05:45.657 --> 00:05:48.880
The best way to grab onto your form is probably

173
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.920
by giving it a name,

174
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.790
rather than a class.

175
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.967
And we'll call that a signup.

176
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.470
And we'll go ahead and select that.

177
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.150
So const signupform is equal to document.querySelector

178
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.660
and if we want to select something based on it's name,

179
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.340
you use an attribute selector.

180
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.270
This is standard in CSS as well.

181
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.110
You say the name is equal to signup.

182
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.370
You notice I'm using double quotes there,

183
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.200
because I use single in my selector.

184
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.350
Then we take the sign-up form,

185
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.230
and we add an event listener,

186
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.160
and now instead of listening for a click,

187
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.737
we listen for an event that's called the

188
00:06:24.737 --> 00:06:25.970
"submit" event.

189
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.680
And when somebody submits a form,

190
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.810
this event will fire,

191
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.520
and give us access to the form.

192
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.220
So we can take a function here,

193
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.620
that will give us the event,

194
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.930
and then we can,

195
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.580
let's just console.log the event.

196
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.265
Obviously it's gonna go away really quickly,

197
00:06:47.265 --> 00:06:49.060
so if you want to be able to log that,

198
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.510
we can call it event.preventDefault,

199
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.660
just to stop the default of the form from submitting.

200
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.780
You'll see that that's actually,

201
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.520
they put it in the URL here as query params,

202
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.410
that's the default how form works,

203
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.352
and more often then not you actually don't wanna

204
00:07:05.352 --> 00:07:07.470
submit the form to a server side,

205
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.480
but you wanna stop it from submitting.

206
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.950
You wanna stop it from submitting.

207
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.360
Grab those details with JavaScript and continue on.

208
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.313
So now if we go ahead and run it.

209
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.020
Maybe, whenever I'm working with forms,

210
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.160
I like to just give it a default value,

211
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.510
so I'm not having to type in every single time.

212
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:27.780
So, we'll say value,

213
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.020
is equal to Wes Bos

214
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.403
and email value is equal to wesbos@gmail.com.

215
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.493
There we go.

216
00:07:37.493 --> 00:07:38.780
Now when I submit it,

217
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.613
(rapid mouse clicking)

218
00:07:39.613 --> 00:07:40.750
Nothing is happening,

219
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.042
including all of the things that we talked about earlier,

220
00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:44.620
like prevent default,

221
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.871
like stop propagation,

222
00:07:45.871 --> 00:07:48.210
et cetera, et cetera.

223
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.380
Now, what can we do with that?

224
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.450
Well, we could check that the terms and conditions

225
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.191
is checked or not.

226
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:56.190
If that's the case.

227
00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.400
Of course you can just put on required attributes

228
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.689
on to the input boxes.

229
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:05.210
With something like this we take it,

230
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.150
we just type "required."

231
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.550
Now if you try to submit it,

232
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.790
it gives you that little error,

233
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.950
but in some cases you want to do

234
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.800
some extended validation.

235
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.730
And if that's the case, we could check...

236
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.960
Maybe we want to make sure the person's name is not,

237
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.340
I don't know, I'm gonna offend somebody here,

238
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.173
Chad.

239
00:08:24.173 --> 00:08:26.750
We don't want any Chads submitting our form, right?

240
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.090
So what we could do

241
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.470
is we could grab the name.

242
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.256
So we wanna grab the name

243
00:08:33.256 --> 00:08:34.800
input.

244
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.960
So if we console.log,

245
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.823
event.currentTarget,

246
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.853
we'll see the form that we have.

247
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.160
If we console.dir it,

248
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.590
are you able to see...

249
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.350
You're able to see the form here,

250
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.570
and you'll see that we actually have properties

251
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.780
inside

252
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.410
of this

253
00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.850
for each of our inputs.

254
00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.390
So we have a name input,

255
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.020
and somewhere on here we'll have

256
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.460
an email input as well.

257
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.040
And that's kind of cool because there's

258
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.850
two ways we could grab the specific fields from

259
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.683
within it.

260
00:09:12.683 --> 00:09:15.960
We could just console.log

261
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.910
event.currentTarget.name

262
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.060
and .email.

263
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.930
You see those two different input boxes,

264
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.047
and we can take it a step further and tag on

265
00:09:26.047 --> 00:09:27.513
.value onto the end.

266
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.210
And that will give us the raw values

267
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.170
of what are in those input boxes.

268
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.220
And the reason why those are available to us

269
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.650
is because

270
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.830
the inputs

271
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.120
have

272
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.890
a name attribute on them.

273
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:42.810
A name of name,

274
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.430
and a name of email,

275
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.270
and there should be another one with the name of agree.

276
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.333
Let's try that.

277
00:09:51.594 --> 00:09:52.427
On

278
00:09:53.332 --> 00:09:54.165
On

279
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.730
Oh, it's not value,

280
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.100
it's checked when it's a check box.

281
00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.973
So checked.

282
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.870
And then that gives us true

283
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:03.730
if it's checked or not.

284
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.730
So that's probably the easiest way to grab

285
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.900
elements inside of a form.

286
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.980
But we could have also done something like this,

287
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.420
where we see event.currentTarget.querySelector.

288
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.420
And then you can select it based on anything you want,

289
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.840
like a name is equal to email,

290
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.220
type is equal to email,

291
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.440
a specific class on it.

292
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.780
But there is no reason to actually run query selector

293
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.470
if you are using proper names.

294
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.150
And that's all the more reason to use valid semantic

295
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.520
HTML by giving your inputs

296
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.040
a proper name.

297
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.893
Which is great!

298
00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:43.076
(mouse clicking)

299
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.810
Now we can say "If"

300
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.940
We could put this name in...

301
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:50.980
Let's get rid of all this.

302
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.727
We'll say "const name is equal to

303
00:10:52.727 --> 00:10:55.007
"event.currentTarget.name.value

304
00:10:55.007 --> 00:10:58.227
"if your name includes

305
00:10:58.227 --> 00:10:59.060
"Chad."

306
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.507
Is it "includes" or "contains?"

307
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.600
I think it's "contains."

308
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.160
Then

309
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.017
alert

310
00:11:06.017 --> 00:11:07.083
"Sorry bro"

311
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.570
We then can event.preventDefault

312
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.280
inside of there.

313
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.130
So now we'll go ahead and submit it

314
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.430
with Wes.

315
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.840
It just refreshes the page,

316
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.630
and it submits that data.

317
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.213
But if my name was Chad,

318
00:11:22.018 --> 00:11:23.690
(mumbles) actually here.

319
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.032
It's still...

320
00:11:25.032 --> 00:11:25.865
(rapid mouse clicking)

321
00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:27.290
Names not contains is not a function.

322
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.563
Oh maybe it is includes.

323
00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:33.074
(mouse clicking)

324
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.623
Sorry bro.

325
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.640
One kinda interesting thing,

326
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.610
this is a bit of an aside,

327
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.350
but if I do capital C,

328
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.183
Chad,

329
00:11:44.183 --> 00:11:45.150
and submit it,

330
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.960
you'll see that it still works.

331
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.410
And that's because a string includes

332
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.090
is not case-sensitive.

333
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.240
And if you do want to be case-sensitive,

334
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.580
which you have to use something called a regex,

335
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.510
I'm sure we'll go into that in the future,

336
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.490
and that allows you to do case insensitivity

337
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.570
with includes.

338
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.990
Let's talk about other types of events with

339
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.650
form inputs.

340
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:10.080
We have, we have keyup,

341
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.293
we have keydown,

342
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.200
we have

343
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.810
focus,

344
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.063
we have blur,

345
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.450
we have a whole bunch of different types of elements,

346
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.750
and what we can actually do is,

347
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.700
let's take that name input,

348
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.720
so

349
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.040
we take the signupForm,

350
00:12:31.046 --> 00:12:33.280
let's console.log the signupForm,

351
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.750
comment these out for just a second,

352
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.070
make sure we got the form.

353
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:36.903
Good.

354
00:12:36.903 --> 00:12:39.710
And if we take the name input,

355
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.140
that gives us the name input,

356
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.410
so that's the element right there,

357
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.190
we can just listen for events right on there,

358
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.660
no need to select it.

359
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.370
So signupForm.name.addEventListener,

360
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.246
and we're going to listen for the keyup event,

361
00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:54.310
and then we have a function...

362
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.950
Actually, let's make a function here

363
00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.083
called logEvent.

364
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.343
And then we just put an event here.

365
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.560
And in here we can just console.log,

366
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.513
let's just say event.type,

367
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.403
and then we can run logEvent on keyup.

368
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.593
You see, now that it's,

369
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.580
whenever I keyup,

370
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.150
it's telling me that it runs the keyup event.

371
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:36.433
We can also log the event.currentTarget.value,

372
00:13:40.109 --> 00:13:42.800
(mouse clicking)

373
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.230
And this will give us both the name of the event,

374
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.670
as well as what the user has typed in there.

375
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.950
And that's kind of cool,

376
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.783
because...

377
00:13:50.783 --> 00:13:52.220
So if you don't want certain letters,

378
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.370
or certain numbers,

379
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.086
being allowed in a specific input,

380
00:13:56.086 --> 00:14:00.180
then we can simply just prevent the default from happening,

381
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.140
and that would be on a keydown, actually,

382
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.053
so let's duplicate this over.

383
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.830
And say keydown.

384
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.930
I'm going to press my T key,

385
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.920
and you see that we got a keydown...

386
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.200
T key, that's a funny word.

387
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.310
We got a keydown event,

388
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.100
and a keyup event,

389
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.060
and it tells us,

390
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.100
at the keydown event,

391
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.730
it will tell us what the current one is,

392
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.330
and at the keyup event it will tell us

393
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.210
what the value is.

394
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.870
We also have focus and blur,

395
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.913
so let's do that.

396
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.830
Focus and blur is basically just when you focus into an

397
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.150
input, and when you focus out of it,

398
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.300
same with tabbing,

399
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.530
it will trigger a focus and a blur event,

400
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.930
as you go in and out of...

401
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.440
And that can be used for showing styling,

402
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.730
or recording information about how long people spend

403
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.810
on specific inputs.

404
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.530
Pretty handy little events there.

405
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.480
There's a couple of other events around

406
00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.970
the different form elements that we'll go into.

407
00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.660
But those are the big ones that I find myself using

408
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.573
most often.
