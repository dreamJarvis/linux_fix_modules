00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.243
<v Instructor>Welcome back!</v>

3
00:00:13.243 --> 00:00:15.930
In the last video we took a look at justified content,

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.470
which, if you remember, it's a way to align the items,

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.720
this whole kinda group of one to ten,

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.100
to the left, to the right, space between,

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.300
we could center them as well.

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.610
And the main thing that we took away from justified content

9
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.860
is that it aligns this group of items on the main axis,

10
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.100
so by default, the main axis is left to right;

11
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.730
however, we did also look at changing that,

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.240
the main axis, from left to right to top to bottom,

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.860
when we used, what was it, flex direction column.

14
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.900
So, again, when you have flex direction column,

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.610
it changes the axis's, it by default is left to right,

16
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.980
and now it makes it from top to bottom.

17
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.813
Okay.

18
00:00:52.813 --> 00:00:53.646
You're probably sick of me saying that,

19
00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:55.580
but I just wanna drive it home.

20
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.490
Let's now talk about the next one, which is aligned items.

21
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.910
So if we go here, take a look at Chris Coyier's CSS tricks.

22
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.980
Align-items is kinda similar, however,

23
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.640
the main things is we're not concerned

24
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.930
about the main axis, which is left to right.

25
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.490
We're more concerned about the cross axis,

26
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.130
which is, by default, top to bottom.

27
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.060
So, the one thing we need to go ahead

28
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.990
and do here is, if I just go and say,

29
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.310
align items, center, and give it a save,

30
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.410
'cause this is what all everyone kinda goes ahead and do.

31
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.250
They go, oh, flexbox is great at vertically centering items,

32
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.590
I'm just gonna pop a quick align-items, center, refresh,

33
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.040
and everyone gets really frustrated,

34
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.810
'cause, hey, it's not actually centering my items at all.

35
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.300
And the reason is, is because we're

36
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.520
vertically centering things here, along the cross axis,

37
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.780
this container, with the pink border around it,

38
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.590
there's actually no room for it to then go ahead.

39
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.780
So we need to make sure that this container

40
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.340
has some sort of height on it.

41
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.230
Now, if one of your contents were a lot bigger than another,

42
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.890
like, for example, if this ten dropped a little bit down,

43
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.690
you might not need this, but for our cases,

44
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.070
let's pop the a quick height on it.

45
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.070
So, say height, 100vh, and there we go.

46
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.850
Oh, look at that!

47
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.054
It vertically centered them automatically,

48
00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.440
since we have this align items, center right here.

49
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.050
So, let me just take that off real quick,

50
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.470
and give it a refresh.

51
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.010
This is what happens by default,

52
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.760
where we've got all of our items,

53
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.870
and by default, the align items is set

54
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.620
to something called stretch.

55
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.620
So, stretch will then, if we put it in here,

56
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.940
you see, like, nothing happens.

57
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.247
It just starts at the top of the container,

58
00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:44.160
and it will stretch itself all the way

59
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.900
to the bottom of the container.

60
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.810
So, we also have center, which will vertically center them,

61
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.110
so, again, we're still in rows here,

62
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.630
but we are vertically centering them.

63
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.330
We've also got flex start, which will

64
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.830
start them all the way at the top,

65
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.490
even though that this space is available for us.

66
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.460
Oh, we got flex end, which will start it at the end,

67
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.640
and then the other one, so we got start, end,

68
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.563
center, stretch, to default.

69
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.600
The kinda cool one is this thing called baseline,

70
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.265
which, it looks at the text in your--

71
00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:23.780
Let me change this to baseline.

72
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.950
It looks at the text in your items,

73
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.770
and will make sure that the bottom of every single letter,

74
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.230
number, whatever is in there, is aligned properly.

75
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.500
Now, we can't really see that much now,

76
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.290
because they're all the same size,

77
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.020
but if I go ahead and change it,

78
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.570
like, box one, font size 30px, and let's do some other ones.

79
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.460
Box three, font size 150, .box four, font size 200,

80
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.580
I don't know how crazy we're gonna get here.

81
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.413
Ooh, look at that!

82
00:03:47.413 --> 00:03:48.350
So, they get bigger, bigger, bigger.

83
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.183
Maybe I'll do a couple more.

84
00:03:49.183 --> 00:03:53.720
Box five, font size 10, and box 10, font size 77px.

85
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.230
So and again, this is not pixel specific.

86
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.900
It could be m's, rems, vh, whatever you want.

87
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.850
So, when I refresh now, you'll notice

88
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.700
that these are all of different sizes.

89
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.500
The height of these items is dependent

90
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.220
on however big he font is.

91
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.280
However, if you take a line and just

92
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.660
draw it right underneath every text,

93
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.170
it's all going to be perfectly aligned

94
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.750
with the baseline of the font, which is extremely handy.

95
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.420
A lot of times you get these designs

96
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.580
from designers, and you've got,

97
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.700
like, maybe like on the left,

98
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.980
you got a title, and on the right you got, like,

99
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.340
the date, and those are two different sizes,

100
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.840
and to try to vertically or sort of align them

101
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.880
on the baseline of the font, is kinda tricky.

102
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.580
You end up just kinda pushing them around

103
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.800
with maybe position relative, or some margin or padding,

104
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.633
or something like that.

105
00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:46.650
So being able to just, say, align items, baseline,

106
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.540
right along there, that is so nice to have.

107
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.210
And it will just figured it all out for you.

108
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.590
Let's do what we did last time, is change the direction,

109
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.880
so again, tell me, our main access, left to right,

110
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.230
our top access, top to bottom again,

111
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.460
so this is top to bottom,

112
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.460
so if we did flex direction, column,

113
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.410
we are switching our axises, which here is,

114
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.610
it's all gonna start it along the left-hand side of it,

115
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.340
but if I change this to align items, center,

116
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.670
and refresh, that's kinda cool.

117
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.560
What happens here is that our cross axis

118
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.960
is not longer top to bottom, it's left to right,

119
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.170
and that's going to align the items along

120
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.360
that down the center.

121
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.760
So, again, very similar to justified content,

122
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.690
just helpful for us to know that.

123
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.500
The main thing I wanna take away from that

124
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.031
is that it's on the cross axis, and needs a height to work.

125
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:51.614
(upbeat music)
