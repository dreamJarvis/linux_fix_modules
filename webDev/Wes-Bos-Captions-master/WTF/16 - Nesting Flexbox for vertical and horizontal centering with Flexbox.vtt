<v Wes Bos>Welcome back, in this video we're gonna talk</v>

3
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.330
about nesting flexbox and how you can use that

4
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.720
to your advantage when doing a little bit more

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.390
of a complex layout than the stuff we've been doing so far.

6
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.500
And this is something that I stumbled upon fairly recently.

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.610
And it was something like this.

8
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.120
So we have like, a slider up here

9
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.190
and I just put an image there

10
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.910
to kinda give you a feel for it.

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.520
And then underneath the slider we had all of these items

12
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.970
that were for each slide.

13
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.380
So, maybe these four slides here,

14
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.750
then we had back and next buttons.

15
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.370
And I wanted to use flexbox because I wasn't sure how many

16
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.600
of these items were going to be added.

17
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.180
There might be four, there might be two,

18
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.100
there might be three.

19
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.440
And then I also wanted to make sure

20
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.860
that the arrows didn't take up as much space

21
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.090
as the rest of 'em.

22
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.130
So, perfect use case for flexbox.

23
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.760
Where I ran into some trouble was,

24
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.060
I have these, if you just look at the HTML here.

25
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.720
I've got this ul which is gonna be my flex container.

26
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.980
And then I've got li, and inside of that, I have a link.

27
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.760
A pretty standard nav that you're gonna find

28
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.560
in most web development scenarios.

29
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.560
And the problem was that, I wanted to center these things.

30
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.940
Both horizontally and vertically.

31
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.700
Which you might say like, oh, that's perfect in flexbox.

32
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.990
But the problem became where I actually wanted the,

33
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.390
see where I'm hovering?

34
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.380
This kinda darker purple.

35
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.520
That is the link part, 'cause you wanna be able

36
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.550
to click anywhere on that darker purple.

37
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.630
So I wanted that to be stretched.

38
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.630
I wanted that to stretch regardless of how high.

39
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.060
Like you'll see that this line, this is three lines high.

40
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.350
And this one is only one.

41
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.280
So sometimes it's only gonna be one line high,

42
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.690
sometimes it'll be three lines high.

43
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.930
And I wanted it to just stretch to the height

44
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.800
of the biggest one,

45
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.140
which is something flexbox does very well.

46
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.130
The problem with that is, if you want to center them

47
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.390
in that box, then all of a sudden that purple box went

48
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.910
from being this high, 'cause by default the align-item

49
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.970
is stretch, and the align-item went to center,

50
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.370
which it was just the height

51
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.610
of the actual content inside of it.

52
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.170
So, I asked around on Twitter and I finally figured it out.

53
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.550
Which is, the answer to it is nesting flexbox.

54
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.860
So what we're gonna do in this code along is,

55
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.830
I'm gonna start you off with the HTML and the CSS

56
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.520
which I thought we're gonna run into the problem.

57
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.700
And then I'm gonna show you how

58
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.950
we can both edit the CSS and the HTML.

59
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.580
We're gonna have to add one extra element in here,

60
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.430
and we're gonna show you how to fix it.

61
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.820
So, let's get rollin'.

62
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.447
Alright, so what I have open here is our style.css

63
00:02:47.447 --> 00:02:49.140
and our index.html.

64
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.010
Those are just two kinda starter files.

65
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.880
And in our style.css, I've just got some base styles.

66
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.560
So it looks pretty good.

67
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.310
If you open up in your browser it looks like this.

68
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.140
You should see that these things are sort

69
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.120
of running together 'cause by default they're links.

70
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.970
And I added a whole bunch of padding to them

71
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.780
and because links are inline, their padding is going

72
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.160
to overlap and not push them down.

73
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.100
But, not to worry.

74
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.050
We're gonna fix all of that.

75
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.567
And what I also did here is I just took the style,

76
00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:17.860
margin and padding off 'cause by default

77
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.170
that's what all this looks like.

78
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.270
So.

79
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.780
Let's get up and running.

80
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.721
The first thing we need to do is, since these li's,

81
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:27.170
if you see, we're working with the ul.

82
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.877
The ul is going to be our flex container.

83
00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:33.340
And the list items are going to be our flex items.

84
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.600
Flex container, flex items.

85
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.060
And the way we do that is we say, display: flex.

86
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.680
And what that will do is, right away it starts

87
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.160
to look quite a bit better.

88
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.310
We've got all of our list items here.

89
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.660
And they're really just taking up

90
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.410
as much room as they need to.

91
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.150
We've got a little bit of extra space right here.

92
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.110
And you can see a little bit of unevenness at the bottom.

93
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.890
And the way we take care of that,

94
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.590
how do we kinda distribute the extra space evenly?

95
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.590
Well, we say .slider-nav li, which is our flex item.

96
00:04:07.371 --> 00:04:08.204
(typing)
Oh.

97
00:04:08.204 --> 00:04:10.660
Let's go ahead and say our first flex item

98
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.470
and then maybe up here let's give ourselves a comment.

99
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.510
Our flex container.

100
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.370
And I say first because we're gonna actually be nesting them

101
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.550
in just a second, so.

102
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.440
And the way we do that is we'll just say flex:1.

103
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.460
And that will just make them all even.

104
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.600
So give it a refresh, and whoa!

105
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.260
What happened, it starts to look like crap again.

106
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.320
Well, when I don't know what's going on with my layout,

107
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.550
my number one thing to do, is I just put a tiny,

108
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.940
little red border around all of the elements, just

109
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.310
to sorta understand where they are.

110
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.700
And I'll give that a refresh.

111
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.790
Okay, this makes a little bit more sense

112
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.050
to us where we've got these list items.

113
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.960
And they're actually falling perfectly into place.

114
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.683
It's just the links that are giving us some grief.

115
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.990
We are going to make these nested flex in just a second.

116
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.870
But we're not gonna get there just yet,

117
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.287
so let's say,

118
00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:11.760
.slider-nav a.

119
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.167
Just say display: block with 100%.

120
00:05:15.262 --> 00:05:16.910
And what that will do is--

121
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:17.860
There we go,

122
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.940
that'll just make things look a little bit nicer

123
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.393
so we can kinda see what we're dealing with here.

124
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.910
Again, we've got our flex item, which is this.

125
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.910
And then we've got our individual links inside of that.

126
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.550
Now a couple things I want to happen here.

127
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.670
I want these links to stretch themselves entirely across.

128
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.650
And then I want the text

129
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.800
to be centered both horizontally and vertically.

130
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.870
And then finally, I want these arrows on either end,

131
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.980
to be a lot smaller.

132
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.510
So let's actually start with those arrows.

133
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.077
We will go ahead and select each of them.

134
00:05:55.077 --> 00:05:56.133
.slider-nav li,

135
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.480
er, .arrow, I think that's it,

136
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.830
let's check our HTML, yup.

137
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.640
We got a class arrow, and a class arrow.

138
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.393
We coulda also said slider-nav li:

139
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.610
first-child,

140
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.240
and then also do a last one but we got a class on there.

141
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.963
So let's stick with that.

142
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.720
And I want these to be about half the size of the rest.

143
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.000
So I'm actually gonna put flex:1 on here and then go back

144
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.090
to our other one and make that a flex:2, so that these ones

145
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.300
will take up double the room of the arrows.

146
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.600
So let's see how we're doin' there.

147
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.370
Okay, that looks a lot better.

148
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.190
We've got these two arrows being a little bit smaller

149
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.000
than the rest of them.

150
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.070
Now I wanna go ahead and center the text.

151
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.980
So let's look at our flex items here and just centering

152
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.040
horizontal is just text-align: center, we can do

153
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.370
that pretty quickly, that looks good.

154
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.170
But now is where the hard part comes.

155
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.120
This is where I thought I was almost done,

156
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.360
and I could just say like, align-items: center

157
00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.890
and we'd be off to the races.

158
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:00.870
So let's try that.

159
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.260
If you remember from the, one of the first videos,

160
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
the align-items

161
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.030
goes on the cross axis.

162
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.730
So if you remember it from left to right is the main axis

163
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.770
and the cross axis by default is top to bottom.

164
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:14.750
So, that's what we want.

165
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.350
We want aligned items 'cause we wanna center these suckers

166
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.163
vertically across this axis right here.

167
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.460
Where do we put align-items?

168
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.160
If you're not sure, you can always head back

169
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.530
to the CSS-Tricks article here.

170
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.480
And go and look for the align-items property.

171
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.905
Let's just take a look here.

172
00:07:34.905 --> 00:07:37.430
(typing)
Align-items, here we go.

173
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.060
The align-items, it looks like it goes on the parent.

174
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.310
The flex container.

175
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.050
So what's the flex container in our situation?

176
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.590
Well, it's the ul.

177
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.700
So we need to go back up to that.

178
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.170
And we'll say,

179
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.830
align-items:center.

180
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.810
And then this is where I thought I'd be good to go.

181
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.713
Refresh, and--oh!

182
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.700
Well, that's not exactly what I wanted.

183
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.510
Now it depends on how much content is in there.

184
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.010
Now they're just resizing them.

185
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.683
So the default is something called stretch.

186
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.980
Which is great, because you can see on the list items.

187
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.130
We're not talking about the links just yet.

188
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.470
The list items are stretching as high as the highest one is,

189
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.660
which is, this one is setting the height of it.

190
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.500
If we were to change that,

191
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.360
like if you added a whole bunch more content in there.

192
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.090
You'll see that the list items, all of 'em span the height

193
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.170
of the tallest one.

194
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.550
So, that align-items: center,

195
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.080
(typing)

196
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.170
doesn't really work for us, because we still want them--

197
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.823
We essentially want center, and we want align-items:stretch.

198
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.330
You can't just do both, unfortunately.

199
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.040
So what we actually need to do is do neither of these.

200
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.800
And what we kinda wanna say is,

201
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.750
the list items should stretch all the way,

202
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.980
the lengths should stretch all the way.

203
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.040
And then whatever's inside

204
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.210
of it will vertically align itself.

205
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.510
What we actually need to do now, is use nested flexbox.

206
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:17.510
So this slider-nav li, it is still going to be a flex item.

207
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.767
Same with the arrow, they are gonna be flex items

208
00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:24.270
and you can still append a flex property to a flex item.

209
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.000
However, we can also make it a flex container as well.

210
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.873
So we'll say display:flex.

211
00:09:31.817 --> 00:09:34.040
We'll say display:flex and still flex:2,

212
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.900
so maybe we'll put a little comment there that says,

213
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.220
this is flex

214
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.263
item -ish.

215
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.510
So that's like a property that would go on a flex item.

216
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.030
But then this, this is flex

217
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.003
container -ish.

218
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.760
And when we say display:flex on that list item there,

219
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.960
give it a refresh.

220
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.370
Ah-ha-hah!

221
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.020
Now we're starting to get places.

222
00:10:02.215 --> 00:10:06.380
Because we made this list item display:flex,

223
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:12.470
it is now a flex container and now what is our flex item?

224
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.470
Well, if you make something a parent, a flex container,

225
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.210
then the immediate child, which in this case is our links,

226
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.930
they become flex items.

227
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.940
So that's great, we already got a selector down here.

228
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.820
And this is where we can take off all of that,

229
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.820
and don't worry about that, we can just say flex-basis:100%.

230
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:38.803
Okay, good.

231
00:10:38.803 --> 00:10:41.220
So that got us a little bit further.

232
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.020
We just took off that temporary fix, and now

233
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.360
since this is a flex item we can use our flex-basis.

234
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.770
However we still have the problem of the vertical centering.

235
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.390
We still aren't able to vertically center them.

236
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.390
And I really wish we just had like a text-align:vertical

237
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.850
right now and just save it, and we'd be off to the races.

238
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.500
But it's just not something that we have in CSS.

239
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.603
So what we could try is, we could try,

240
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.503
on our list items,

241
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.720
say align-items:center

242
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.520
and maybe that will center it.

243
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.970
It does, but (laughs),

244
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.000
we still have the problem

245
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
of these items since they're not by default they're stretch,

246
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.830
by saying this, we're saying the links,

247
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.230
these guys right here need to stretch.

248
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.560
But,

249
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.610
that still doesn't work.

250
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.900
It's similar, and maybe you think, oh,

251
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.550
well we also have one called align-self.

252
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.920
And could we say align-self:center?

253
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.980
No, that does the same thing.

254
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.450
That just tells the list items to align itself

255
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.870
in the center of the parent.

256
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.460
Again, we're in the situation where we want,

257
00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.320
maybe we'll put a little comment, we want

258
00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.590
to stretch

259
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.880
as well

260
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.870
as center.

261
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.400
So, we need to go one step further

262
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.200
and do another display:flex.

263
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.630
Now, if we say display:flex on this one right here,

264
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.920
and give it a save.

265
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.500
You'll see that, okay good.

266
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.930
This is pretty much what we want.

267
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.830
Only now we've got a couple more issues.

268
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.390
And when we made that display:flex, let me bring that back.

269
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.363
What it did,

270
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.880
is it stretched them all the way across.

271
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.970
However, like,

272
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.870
look at the--our text line center

273
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.150
no longer goes all the way across, as well

274
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.593
as the vertically centering doesn't work out all just yet.

275
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.230
If we make the link flex, which is now a flex container,

276
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.763
as well as a flex item,

277
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.810
we don't have a flex item that's inside of the link.

278
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.270
'Cause if you look at a link,

279
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.830
this is just the content, right?

280
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.630
So we don't have any element inside of here

281
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:05.210
that we can then apply our align-items to.

282
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.580
This is unfortunately where we need to go ahead

283
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.200
and add another element inside of this link.

284
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.200
And the easiest way to sorta do that is to just wrap a span

285
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.823
around all of the elements that we have.

286
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.943
Just gonna wrap a span around each of those.

287
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.960
And we will give ourselves a selector for that.

288
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.763
So .slider-nav span,

289
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.850
and we can give ourselves a little comment that says,

290
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.593
this is the flex item.

291
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:45.570
And on our link here, we can now say align-items:center,

292
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.020
because when we say align-items, it's going

293
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:54.530
to take the child flex item and center it.

294
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.970
So let's see where that brings us.

295
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.460
Okay, good, good, good.

296
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.410
Now we're almost there.

297
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.590
I got a couple of issues here now.

298
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.040
We've got,

299
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.680
it looks like these links right here

300
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.790
aren't centering themselves.

301
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.000
Looks like none of our text is centering us.

302
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.410
We've got a little bit of a weirdness going on here.

303
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.300
So what we need to do is,

304
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.010
because by default spans are displayed inline, we need

305
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.023
to change those to display: block.

306
00:14:21.982 --> 00:14:23.160
And refresh.

307
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.530
That does nothing for us, why?

308
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.793
'Cause we need to give it a width of 100%.

309
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.480
Okay, getting there, getting there.

310
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.560
Our one last little issue that we have here is like,

311
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.060
what's going on with this one.

312
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.750
Why is it kinda wrapping around here?

313
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.510
And I'm not actually sure what's going on here.

314
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.030
Probably a little bug on my end, you're probably yelling

315
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.240
at me right now.

316
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.073
It's super clear--Oh!

317
00:14:45.073 --> 00:14:46.020
There we go.

318
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.970
So I, (laughs) when I wrapped the span around the text,

319
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.290
it looks like I didn't get it all.

320
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.970
So let me jump back to this one right here.

321
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.240
Oh and it's 'cause it was on a multiline.

322
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.740
Make sure you put all the text inside of the span.

323
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:00.663
And.

324
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.400
That should do it.

325
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.900
Let me take off that little, red, ugly border there

326
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.450
to make sure we're okay.

327
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.193
And we're hovering it, great.

328
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.370
Maybe I wanna add some font size

329
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.160
to the--Oops!

330
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.260
Not to those.

331
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.010
I wanna add it just to the arrows.

332
00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.447
So,

333
00:15:19.447 --> 00:15:21.080
.arrow a.

334
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.310
Font-size: 30px.

335
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.700
There we go, that's kinda the one nice thing about flexbox,

336
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.090
is you can just jack-up the font size,

337
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.840
and you're not gonna mess up your vertical centering

338
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.040
on the items that are different font sizes.

339
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.370
So, I know that's a little bit confusing to follow.

340
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.750
However, if you ever run into a situation

341
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.950
where you need items to both stretch

342
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.130
as well as be vertically centered, you have

343
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.630
to do the whole nesting flexbox thing.

344
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.050
And hopefully this will be a pretty decent,

345
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.610
little starter template that you can pull out of

346
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.610
and sorta customize to make your own.

347
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.214
See you in the next video.
