<v ->Hi there, I'm Wes Bos,</v>

3
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.910
thank you so much for checking out what the flexbox.

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.550
This is 20 videos aimed at getting you

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.840
up and running with flexbox.

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.050
So, I created these videos because flexbox is hard.

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.055
It's really, really powerful,

8
00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:26.846
but there's really a lot to it

9
00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:27.930
and you can often find yourself stumbling

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.130
and trying to figure out what combination of property values

11
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.810
you actually need to make it do what you want.

12
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.750
So, of the 20 videos, the first 13 are flexbox fundamentals.

13
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.180
So, we go through every single piece of flexbox,

14
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.201
all the property values.

15
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:44.141
Really understanding what they do,

16
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:46.110
when you use them, and how you use them.

17
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.300
And then the seven, the last seven,

18
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.010
are more real life examples.

19
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.620
So, what we're gonna do is go ahead

20
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.870
and build something like a flexbox navigation,

21
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.010
or a flexbox form, or at the end

22
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.860
we're gonna build a mobile app layout entirely in flexbox.

23
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.500
So, sign on up for the videos.

24
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.670
You can grab all of them, as well as the exercises,

25
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.300
by just popping your email in there.

26
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.730
And I will see you soon,

27
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.610
let me know what you think.

28
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.461
Thanks so much.
