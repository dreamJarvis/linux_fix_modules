00:00:00.308 --> 00:00:03.725
(lively whistling music)

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.470
<v Wes>Welcome back if you made it this far.</v>

3
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.267
Congratulations, this is probably

4
00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:19.359
the most ambitious one that we'll take on

5
00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.598
and really you'll probably find it's not too tough

6
00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:25.657
once we sorta breakdown the big ideas

7
00:00:25.657 --> 00:00:28.689
and that is building sorta this app layout that's

8
00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.369
so common on a mobile phone with FlexBox.

9
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.649
Now I think this is super important because when you're

10
00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.008
on a phone you are constrained by the height or the width

11
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:42.038
of the phone and you need to be able to have something

12
00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:47.038
that you can just manage the height of the application

13
00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.438
so what I've gone is ahead is I've built this little app

14
00:00:50.438 --> 00:00:51.478
that we have here

15
00:00:51.478 --> 00:00:54.038
and you can see when you resize it vertically

16
00:00:54.038 --> 00:00:58.287
because all phones can be different sizes,

17
00:00:58.287 --> 00:00:59.767
same with horizontally actually.

18
00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:01.798
If you resize it vertically and horizontally

19
00:01:01.798 --> 00:01:04.287
it will just kinda react to go ahead

20
00:01:04.287 --> 00:01:07.954
with it and I have no media queries in here,

21
00:01:08.848 --> 00:01:12.038
no floats, no widths, no heights, none of that stuff.

22
00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:13.977
It's all using FlexBox

23
00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:18.227
so I think this is gonna be really big for FlexBox,

24
00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:21.416
to be building this kinda thing.

25
00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:24.617
In fact if you've heard of React Native.

26
00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:28.336
React Native is this framework where you can write apps

27
00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:30.689
in JavaScript and it gets complied into native.

28
00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.534
The way that they handle their layouts is with FlexBox

29
00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:37.809
so it's kind of important to know this stuff.

30
00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:40.657
So let's get started, this is exactly what we're building.

31
00:01:40.657 --> 00:01:42.546
We got things on the left, things on the right,

32
00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:45.256
things that are centered, we got all these buttons

33
00:01:45.256 --> 00:01:46.697
that are the same amount.

34
00:01:46.697 --> 00:01:48.337
Then we got this content area,

35
00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:50.049
that's just gonna take up the rest

36
00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.326
of the room after we take room for the header

37
00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:56.278
and the icon bar there.

38
00:01:56.278 --> 00:02:00.945
So let's jump on in and I am just gonna change this back

39
00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:06.027
to my base style and I want you to open up style.css

40
00:02:06.027 --> 00:02:10.009
and you're gonna see tons of different CSS here

41
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.817
and let me refresh that to see what we're starting with.

42
00:02:12.817 --> 00:02:16.387
So this is just again, it's all just cosmetic stuff.

43
00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:17.817
Nothing here really has anything

44
00:02:17.817 --> 00:02:20.337
to do with the Flex property,

45
00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:21.427
except that one shouldn't be in there

46
00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:24.417
and we are starting off with this.

47
00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:27.689
So we've got the header, see this link is on one line,

48
00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.836
this is on another and this is on a third.

49
00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:33.836
We've got this content area, let's look at the HTML

50
00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:34.849
while we do this, we go the app wrap

51
00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.217
which is this sorta black thing that looks like a phone.

52
00:02:38.217 --> 00:02:41.129
We got the header which is this big yellow part.

53
00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.576
We got the div of the class of content

54
00:02:42.576 --> 00:02:44.737
which is the white that has a whole bunch

55
00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:48.798
of content in there and we got this div with the class

56
00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:51.569
of a icon bar and inside of that I've got a whole bunch

57
00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.707
of links, inside of that we've got some text

58
00:02:55.707 --> 00:02:59.777
and we've got some font awesome icons which we're using.

59
00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:02.857
So let's get started, I am gonna go through this kinda

60
00:03:02.857 --> 00:03:04.456
by section by section,

61
00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:08.373
just so that we can understand what's going on.

62
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.220
Let's start with the overall layout,

63
00:03:14.478 --> 00:03:16.117
right now it's just spilling out

64
00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:19.713
and that's because that app wrapper,

65
00:03:19.713 --> 00:03:21.067
where do we got it here,

66
00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:24.734
the app wrap I've put a height of 90vh on it

67
00:03:25.798 --> 00:03:30.798
and that means it's 90 percent of the height of the browser,

68
00:03:31.026 --> 00:03:32.598
you'll see that right here it resizes

69
00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:34.577
but the content doesn't come along with it.

70
00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:38.494
So let's get all that fixed up and ready to go.

71
00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:41.249
So first thing that we are going to do

72
00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:45.832
is select the app wrap and we're gonna turn on FlexBox,

73
00:03:47.476 --> 00:03:52.078
sorry, display Flex, give that a save and when you refresh,

74
00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:54.328
wooh, what's going on here,

75
00:03:55.198 --> 00:03:59.838
so it puts the navigation here, which would be interesting

76
00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:01.387
for some apps, I guess you could slide it up

77
00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:03.417
from the side but this is kind of what we've been working

78
00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:07.336
with a lot so far and it's not what we want

79
00:04:07.336 --> 00:04:09.026
for working with an app.

80
00:04:09.026 --> 00:04:11.718
We don't want to deal with rows, we want to deal with

81
00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:13.438
or we don't want to deal with one row,

82
00:04:13.438 --> 00:04:15.266
we want to deal with multiple columns,

83
00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:19.426
so the way that we change the axis so the horizontal

84
00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.905
and the vertical axis, the main axis

85
00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:26.155
and the cross axis is, we say flex direction column

86
00:04:30.032 --> 00:04:33.721
and that will stack them on top of each other.

87
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:36.771
So we're kinda back where we were, we got this, we got that

88
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:41.521
and we are there and then we also want to set these items

89
00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.179
to both grow and shrink.

90
00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:48.938
So I am gonna select all of the flex items

91
00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:51.596
in this case it's going to be the icon bar,

92
00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:54.363
it's going to be the content

93
00:04:54.363 --> 00:04:57.129
and it's going to be the app header.

94
00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.848
So say .app, .wrap, I'll seize a star selector

95
00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:05.265
to grab those and say flex and I want it to grow one,

96
00:05:06.604 --> 00:05:09.388
I want it to shrink one,

97
00:05:09.388 --> 00:05:10.942
essentially that means just don't do anything,

98
00:05:10.942 --> 00:05:13.563
stay as the size and I'll tell you why that's important

99
00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.486
in just a second and then finally for the flex basis

100
00:05:16.486 --> 00:05:19.652
how big it should be, I am going to say auto

101
00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.052
and why am I going to say auto,

102
00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:23.652
Because I want this header to take up

103
00:05:23.652 --> 00:05:25.207
as much room as it needs,

104
00:05:25.207 --> 00:05:26.917
maybe it's gonna be more padding or less.

105
00:05:26.917 --> 00:05:30.486
I want this bar here to take up as much room as it needs

106
00:05:30.486 --> 00:05:32.207
and then I want the rest of the content

107
00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:35.959
to be dedicated towards this content area

108
00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:38.830
that we can scroll in there so I am going to say auto,

109
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.734
give that a save and refresh,

110
00:05:40.734 --> 00:05:44.766
and you'll notice that nothing really changed there,

111
00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:48.421
the height of this bar is being taken up by the link

112
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:50.518
and the header and the other link.

113
00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:53.192
However because we said auto we're allowing the content

114
00:05:53.192 --> 00:05:56.609
to go as high as we want and because we have scroll room,

115
00:05:56.609 --> 00:06:00.375
really we've got all the room that we could want.

116
00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:04.964
So what we need to actually do is go to our content,

117
00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:09.297
so lets make a new section there and we'll select it

118
00:06:10.343 --> 00:06:12.510
and say overflow y scroll,

119
00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.030
so we are essentially gonna be turning on the scroll

120
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.222
for this one right here and then when we refresh,

121
00:06:21.222 --> 00:06:24.341
interesting what happens, the header takes up

122
00:06:24.341 --> 00:06:27.886
as much room as it needs, the footer or the icon bar

123
00:06:27.886 --> 00:06:29.413
takes up as much room as it needs

124
00:06:29.413 --> 00:06:32.941
and then the content just kinda takes the rest

125
00:06:32.941 --> 00:06:34.703
and because we put scroll on it

126
00:06:34.703 --> 00:06:37.574
it will just scroll for the rest.

127
00:06:37.574 --> 00:06:38.732
One other thing we need to put on there

128
00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:42.899
is webkit overflow scrolling and we will say touch

129
00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:47.445
and what that will do is,

130
00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:51.328
if you have ever been on a web site on your phone

131
00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:54.345
and you try to go through a scrolling content area

132
00:06:54.345 --> 00:06:56.181
and it doesn't have that kind of flick to scroll,

133
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:58.335
the initial scrolling, that's because you haven't turn on

134
00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.729
overflow scrolling touch to it.

135
00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.181
So if you test this out on your phone it will work great.

136
00:07:03.181 --> 00:07:05.055
So now that we've got that, that's great.

137
00:07:05.055 --> 00:07:07.392
And you can see that this is still huge,

138
00:07:07.392 --> 00:07:12.392
but because it's huge it's gonna take up that room for now,

139
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:14.997
we're gonna get it trimmed down much smaller

140
00:07:14.997 --> 00:07:16.214
in just a second.

141
00:07:16.214 --> 00:07:18.761
So that's the content and I'm gonna go above that

142
00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:21.094
and we'll do the header now.

143
00:07:22.394 --> 00:07:25.596
And how should we best lay this out,

144
00:07:25.596 --> 00:07:27.694
if you noticed before we had the back button

145
00:07:27.694 --> 00:07:31.194
on the left, we had this H1 in the middle,

146
00:07:36.094 --> 00:07:39.831
and we've got this cog icon on the right hand side.

147
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:41.358
Now previously this would have been done

148
00:07:41.358 --> 00:07:44.229
with floats or you'd maybe say this one is 20 percent,

149
00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:47.974
this one is 70 percent and you give each of them

150
00:07:47.974 --> 00:07:49.773
up to 100 percent,

151
00:07:49.773 --> 00:07:51.972
and thankfully we don't have to do that anymore,

152
00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:54.406
we have the control in FlexBox.

153
00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:56.869
So let's go ahead and select it.

154
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:59.452
.app-header and this app header

155
00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:03.588
is also going to be display flex.

156
00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:07.910
Why, because we want the header to be flex

157
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.478
and we want the link, the H1 and the other link

158
00:08:10.478 --> 00:08:14.678
to also be flex items so we can easily put them

159
00:08:14.678 --> 00:08:17.045
to the left, to the right in the middle.

160
00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:19.046
Display flex and now when we refresh that,

161
00:08:19.046 --> 00:08:22.167
look at what we got going on here.

162
00:08:22.167 --> 00:08:24.295
It puts them all on the same line,

163
00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.998
the H1 is no longer block like where it takes up

164
00:08:26.998 --> 00:08:28.958
its own line, it's right in the line there,

165
00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.493
and then these icons, what's going on with them

166
00:08:31.493 --> 00:08:32.740
why are they so big.

167
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.411
The reason behind that is because it's taking the height

168
00:08:37.411 --> 00:08:39.460
of this H1 and determining that that's the height

169
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.725
and by default these are gonna stretch.

170
00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:43.223
So we need to go ahead and change that,

171
00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:45.640
we'll say align items center.

172
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:48.041
And what that does

173
00:08:49.708 --> 00:08:52.516
is remember we're on the flipped access now,

174
00:08:52.516 --> 00:08:54.408
it's gonna vertically center them

175
00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:56.301
so they're all centered in there,

176
00:08:56.301 --> 00:08:59.967
and now we've got the issue where we've got this title,

177
00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:02.782
FlexBox app layout and we need this to go to the right,

178
00:09:02.782 --> 00:09:03.846
this to go to the left,

179
00:09:03.846 --> 00:09:06.281
you might be thinking yeah just add a bunch of padding

180
00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:08.789
until it works out but remember this is,

181
00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:10.958
we're not sure what the screen size is gonna be,

182
00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.567
so we sort of need to account for

183
00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:14.233
all of the different screen sizes,

184
00:09:14.233 --> 00:09:15.733
whether it be bigger or smaller.

185
00:09:15.733 --> 00:09:20.281
And luckily for us we have the justify content

186
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:22.531
and remember space between.

187
00:09:25.615 --> 00:09:27.549
What that will do is it will take the extra space

188
00:09:27.549 --> 00:09:29.311
which is right here and it's going to put it

189
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:33.005
in between the element so how many in between elements

190
00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:34.617
do we have, well we've got three elements,

191
00:09:34.617 --> 00:09:37.110
but we have two spots, one to the left of the F

192
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.574
and one to the right of the T,

193
00:09:39.574 --> 00:09:42.038
that it's going to divi that space on up.

194
00:09:42.038 --> 00:09:43.868
So refresh, oh yeah lookin' real good.

195
00:09:43.868 --> 00:09:47.653
Pretty simple, if I go in here and I were to change this

196
00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:51.153
to Wes is cool, you know it's much smaller

197
00:09:52.438 --> 00:09:55.629
but it still works perfectly, no fiddling with floats

198
00:09:55.629 --> 00:09:59.453
and text lines it just works perfectly.

199
00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:03.027
Um, so that's good for that, we've got this part working

200
00:10:03.027 --> 00:10:07.171
and now really all we have left to do is this icon bar here.

201
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:10.682
So let's create ourselves a third section,

202
00:10:10.682 --> 00:10:12.932
we'll call it the icon bar,

203
00:10:14.657 --> 00:10:17.475
and for the icon bar it's gonna be pretty simple,

204
00:10:17.475 --> 00:10:21.225
grab that and we'll say display flex as well,

205
00:10:22.082 --> 00:10:26.499
and when that is flex, sorry, not icon it's icon bar,

206
00:10:28.018 --> 00:10:30.034
when the icon bar is flex,

207
00:10:30.034 --> 00:10:33.547
all of these links which are the immediate children,

208
00:10:33.547 --> 00:10:35.880
are gonna become flex items,

209
00:10:37.087 --> 00:10:39.860
and they go right beside each other.

210
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.115
Now we've got all this extra space right here

211
00:10:42.115 --> 00:10:46.595
and what do we do to specify the extra space,

212
00:10:46.595 --> 00:10:51.379
well we apply a flex grow and a flex shrink on it.

213
00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:54.924
So we will go ahead and say icon bar A,

214
00:10:54.924 --> 00:10:58.340
select all the links and we'll simply just say flex one.

215
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.819
And what that will do is it will set a flex grow

216
00:11:00.819 --> 00:11:04.204
and a flex shrink of one, which means that the extra space

217
00:11:04.204 --> 00:11:06.330
or when there's not enough space,

218
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.227
they'll evenly get space or have it taken away from them.

219
00:11:10.227 --> 00:11:13.251
So refresh, ooh, very nice, right up and working.

220
00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:15.517
So again just a couple of lines of code

221
00:11:15.517 --> 00:11:18.426
understanding that this is the power of FlexBox

222
00:11:18.426 --> 00:11:22.267
if I were to ever resize this thing horizontally

223
00:11:22.267 --> 00:11:27.267
or vertically, everything sort of just goes into place.

224
00:11:27.461 --> 00:11:30.707
So hopefully you like that one, let me know what you think,

225
00:11:30.707 --> 00:11:32.220
and I'll see you soon.

226
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.553
(lively whistling music)
