(upbeat whistling)

2
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Wes>Hello everyone, and welcome to the first video.</v>

3
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.369
In this video I'm gonna get you set up with Flexbox.

4
00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.012
I wanna make sure that your comfortable

5
00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:20.338
with the markup that we're going to be using.

6
00:00:20.338 --> 00:00:22.686
As we as comfortable with the two

7
00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:27.456
fundamental concepts of flex container and flex item.

8
00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:28.472
So, what do we got here?

9
00:00:28.472 --> 00:00:30.406
We've got a div class container,

10
00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:33.118
inside of that I have a whole bunch of boxes.

11
00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:35.948
So this is going to be our flex container

12
00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:39.689
and each of these are going to be our flex items.

13
00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:40.975
Now these don't have to be divs,

14
00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:42.941
they can be really anything you want:

15
00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:46.225
images, sections, paragraph tags, whatever you really want.

16
00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:48.821
But for the case of simplicity here,

17
00:00:48.821 --> 00:00:51.321
I've just done plain old divs.

18
00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:54.401
I've given them classes just so I can style them,

19
00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:57.083
but again that's not totally necessary.

20
00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:59.023
In the CSS here I've just got some neuro lines,

21
00:00:59.023 --> 00:01:02.953
got my border box again not necessary for Flexbox.

22
00:01:02.953 --> 00:01:05.691
This right here just gives it some basic styling as well,

23
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:07.213
some colors for the background there.

24
00:01:07.213 --> 00:01:10.646
So if I give a refresh here this is what I've got.

25
00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:12.831
We just got div all the way across each one is

26
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:15.135
sort of stacked on top of each other.

27
00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:18.495
Now we can, on line 31 here we're going to go ahead

28
00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.625
and start writing our flexbox.

29
00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:23.895
The way that we do that is that we define

30
00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:26.805
the container as display flex.

31
00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:29.049
Now that's really important because you might

32
00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.484
be coming to this thinking, okay we have display block,

33
00:01:31.484 --> 00:01:33.735
inline, inline block, and a couple of

34
00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:35.731
other kind of edge case ones.

35
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:38.392
And this is a totally new way to think

36
00:01:38.392 --> 00:01:39.811
about laying out your website.

37
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:44.411
So if you really come at this at the perspective of

38
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:46.083
something like, I'm bringing my floats here,

39
00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:48.237
I'm bringing my widths and I'm bringing my percentage.

40
00:01:48.237 --> 00:01:51.688
We sort of have to put that aside and kind of take this

41
00:01:51.688 --> 00:01:53.188
into something that is new to us.

42
00:01:53.188 --> 00:01:56.032
So, if I set that to be display flex and give

43
00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:58.056
us refresh, watch what happens.

44
00:01:58.056 --> 00:02:02.762
Okay, so what happened there is my container here--

45
00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:06.345
let me put a border on it, 10px golden rod.

46
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:08.745
Give it a save.

47
00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:11.304
You see that the flex container it goes

48
00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:14.221
all the way across the entire page.

49
00:02:15.174 --> 00:02:17.134
And that's similar to block level elements.

50
00:02:17.134 --> 00:02:21.722
However, we also have one called inline flex and inline flex

51
00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:24.217
is just like an inline element, like a span or something.

52
00:02:24.217 --> 00:02:26.328
It'll really just kind of wrap around the content and

53
00:02:26.328 --> 00:02:29.568
only take about the width that it needs.

54
00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:32.552
I'm going to bring the back to flex and refresh.

55
00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:36.926
Our flex container goes all the way across and by defining

56
00:02:36.926 --> 00:02:41.170
this container as display flex, what happens is

57
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.046
automatically these divs right here become flex items.

58
00:02:46.046 --> 00:02:50.192
The relationship between the mediate children

59
00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:54.359
of the flex container makes these divs flex items.

60
00:02:55.202 --> 00:02:56.511
We don't have to do anything special, we don't

61
00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:59.151
have to make it say display flex item on them.

62
00:02:59.151 --> 00:03:03.135
They are just automatically turned into flex items.

63
00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:06.112
One last thing I want to kind of get you set up on;

64
00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:07.105
in the next video we're going to be

65
00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:10.113
talking about axis's and flex direction.

66
00:03:10.113 --> 00:03:12.437
When I first learned it it tripped me up a little

67
00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:15.403
because when we flipped the direction

68
00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.923
things started stretching around for me.

69
00:03:17.923 --> 00:03:20.504
What I want to do is that when you're working with Flexbox

70
00:03:20.504 --> 00:03:23.924
it's handy to have a box that at least has some sort of

71
00:03:23.924 --> 00:03:26.939
hight on it, just so that we can visualize what's going on.

72
00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.534
In your real world websites the hight would come from

73
00:03:29.534 --> 00:03:32.738
the actual content that takes up your elements.

74
00:03:32.738 --> 00:03:37.272
But I want to go ahead and just say hight 100VH.

75
00:03:37.272 --> 00:03:38.756
Now if your ar not familiar with VH,

76
00:03:38.756 --> 00:03:41.282
that stands for view port hight.

77
00:03:41.282 --> 00:03:42.900
And what that will do is it will just

78
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.092
make the container stretch the entire hight.

79
00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:49.138
It's kind of like hight 100%

80
00:03:49.138 --> 00:03:50.774
It's just a new way to say it.

81
00:03:50.774 --> 00:03:53.242
That really has nothing to do with Flexbox.

82
00:03:53.242 --> 00:03:55.342
It's just a nice way for us to get a

83
00:03:55.342 --> 00:03:58.416
100% hight on our div here.

84
00:03:58.416 --> 00:04:00.576
When we resize vertically we don't really

85
00:04:00.576 --> 00:04:03.922
have to worry about any 100% hight hacks.

86
00:04:03.922 --> 00:04:06.444
That's just getting set up, one quick review.

87
00:04:06.444 --> 00:04:10.263
We've got our flex container, as well as our flex items.

88
00:04:10.263 --> 00:04:12.608
The next one we're going to be taking a look at

89
00:04:12.608 --> 00:04:16.515
sort of a fundamental idea of axis's and flex direction.

90
00:04:16.515 --> 00:04:19.225
(upbeat whistling)
