00:00:00.785 --> 00:00:01.618
(whistling)

2
00:00:01.618 --> 00:00:04.201
(finger snaps)

3
00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:14.561
<v ->Alright. Let's move into some code logs.</v>

4
00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:16.351
Before we do that we need to set up

5
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:17.872
what's called build step.

6
00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:22.120
The reason behind that is because Flexbox is actually been

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.411
around for quite a while.

8
00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:26.403
However its gone through three different iterations

9
00:00:26.403 --> 00:00:28.453
of how Flexbox works.

10
00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:30.693
And as these things came out,

11
00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:33.918
Chris Coyier got an awesome little article here, about it.

12
00:00:33.918 --> 00:00:35.555
As it came out browser ship,

13
00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:38.691
there is still quite a few browsers out there that either

14
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:41.933
implement the old version of Flexbox

15
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.792
or there are some device that have vendor prefix

16
00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:48.521
Flexbox so if you try to run any of these

17
00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:52.131
demos just straight up in any other browser other

18
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:56.400
then most recent Chrome or Firefox you are gonna run

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.021
into a bunch of issues.

20
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:00.781
So luckily for us we don't have to figure out what

21
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:03.459
all of the different things are.

22
00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:07.080
We can just run our code through a compiled step so.

23
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.100
Here is another silly example I was looking at.

24
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.982
The flex-basis documentation on mdm for flex-basis.

25
00:01:14.982 --> 00:01:18.958
It says a brief history it was originally flex-basis auto

26
00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.037
then they changed it to main size then they changed

27
00:01:22.037 --> 00:01:26.118
it back so clearly when they were fleshing out

28
00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.924
Flexbox there was a lot of confusion and maybe

29
00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:32.457
a little disagreement as to what was going on.

30
00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:35.318
But never fear we have this thing called autoprefixer

31
00:01:35.318 --> 00:01:39.037
and you may have actually heard of it before.

32
00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:42.277
And what autoprefixer does it it just takes your code

33
00:01:42.277 --> 00:01:47.249
and the idea is we write our code with the latest and

34
00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:49.157
cleanest flexbox spec.

35
00:01:49.157 --> 00:01:51.982
So I just got some of the code we did here on one of the

36
00:01:51.982 --> 00:01:52.815
other ones.

37
00:01:52.815 --> 00:01:53.865
I am going to paste it in,

38
00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:55.198
and what it will do,

39
00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.737
holy shit look what it does.

40
00:01:56.737 --> 00:02:00.431
It takes your nice clean flexbox code and it will just

41
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:04.118
prefix all of the possible vendor prefixes

42
00:02:04.118 --> 00:02:04.951
as well as

43
00:02:06.747 --> 00:02:08.622
the older display box.

44
00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:11.990
So you've got display web kit box, ms flexbox, flex.

45
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.573
Box orient vertical

46
00:02:15.092 --> 00:02:16.205
etc. etc. etc.

47
00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:18.788
There is no way to possibly maintain this by hand.

48
00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:21.394
It's not like you are just doing transition

49
00:02:21.394 --> 00:02:24.274
and web kit transition its just way to hard

50
00:02:24.274 --> 00:02:26.230
To be able to maintain it all.

51
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.580
So the idea is we are going to have a build step

52
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.940
that looks at all of our stuff.

53
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.964
Let me get centered here.

54
00:02:33.964 --> 00:02:36.955
Got that back in real quick.

55
00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:39.587
So the idea is we are going to write the code here

56
00:02:39.587 --> 00:02:40.692
and it is going to be built.

57
00:02:40.692 --> 00:02:43.944
So we are going to be using Gulp.js

58
00:02:43.944 --> 00:02:45.285
there's tons of different

59
00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:48.394
ways you can use autoprefixer to compile your code.

60
00:02:48.394 --> 00:02:50.616
You may have heard of code kit or preproc or

61
00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:51.517
any of these other apps.

62
00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:55.767
Even if you just paste your code into here and have

63
00:02:57.036 --> 00:02:59.586
it spit it out the other end.

64
00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:03.146
However ideally I would have something that watches our

65
00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:05.134
css and every time we save it,

66
00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:07.134
it is going to recompile it into this.

67
00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:10.233
So if you are familiar with Grunt or Gulp and you know what

68
00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:12.677
autoprefixer is then feel free to totally skip this

69
00:03:12.677 --> 00:03:16.026
entire video and move onto the next one.

70
00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:20.018
But if you are new to Gulp I am going to cowboy it and

71
00:03:20.018 --> 00:03:23.778
install it from scratch and show you how I get something

72
00:03:23.778 --> 00:03:25.327
set up like this.

73
00:03:25.327 --> 00:03:28.084
I have an entire book and video series on Gulp coming out

74
00:03:28.084 --> 00:03:30.164
but this should get you up and running

75
00:03:30.164 --> 00:03:32.636
for at least just autoprefixer.

76
00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:36.858
So first thing you need is have nodejs installed, if you

77
00:03:36.858 --> 00:03:40.258
don't have node installed, or if you are not sure.

78
00:03:40.258 --> 00:03:42.775
What you can check is just go to your terminal.

79
00:03:42.775 --> 00:03:46.138
So on your computer there is going to be a terminal

80
00:03:46.138 --> 00:03:49.684
application or there will be one called

81
00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:51.767
powershell on windows and

82
00:03:55.676 --> 00:03:57.462
you just type node minus V

83
00:03:57.462 --> 00:04:00.605
and if you get a number back that means you have node

84
00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:01.438
installed,

85
00:04:01.438 --> 00:04:04.346
if you don't get anything back at all that means you need

86
00:04:04.346 --> 00:04:06.895
to go to nodejs.org and click the downloads.

87
00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:10.214
Next next next it gives you a nice little installer.

88
00:04:10.214 --> 00:04:12.673
So when you have that opened we are going

89
00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:16.873
to head over to the command line in here.

90
00:04:16.873 --> 00:04:20.255
And just go into the directory of where you have something.

91
00:04:20.255 --> 00:04:23.436
So I have just got some index an hml file

92
00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:25.064
I will show you in here.

93
00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:28.505
An index hml file we are not going to be touching that.

94
00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:30.757
And this is just the css that that we are going to be

95
00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:33.633
autoprefixing, so that's it.

96
00:04:33.633 --> 00:04:36.125
We need a couple more files to get up and running.

97
00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:40.281
The first one is what's called a packaged json file

98
00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:44.001
I won't get into it to much but essentially tracks your

99
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:45.569
dependancies.

100
00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.793
Its gonna track the versions in which plug ins we need

101
00:04:48.793 --> 00:04:53.198
installed do to do that you type npm and hit enter

102
00:04:53.198 --> 00:04:55.609
and its just going to give you a whole bunch of

103
00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:57.029
different questions here.

104
00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.668
For our case we are okay to just keep hitting enter

105
00:04:59.668 --> 00:05:02.329
enter enter until you're back at the command line.

106
00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:05.548
And you will see that created a package json file and there

107
00:05:05.548 --> 00:05:08.519
is just some information we will be looking at that in

108
00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:09.803
just a second.

109
00:05:09.803 --> 00:05:14.113
Next up what we want to do is install Gulp.

110
00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:17.916
So you can type you'll need to install Gulp twice actually.

111
00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:20.050
You'll need to install Gulp globally.

112
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.863
The way you do that is you type in npm gulp dash g and that

113
00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:27.896
will install it globally on your entire machine.

114
00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:30.335
If you get issues with that go ahead and put a

115
00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:33.502
pseudo npm gulp dash g in front of it.

116
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.973
Sometimes people don't have the correct permissions to run

117
00:05:37.973 --> 00:05:41.459
install on the global level so you have to type sudo

118
00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:45.180
here I will show you and hit enter and its going to ask you

119
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.062
for your password.

120
00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:48.822
You type in your password it won't show anything up here

121
00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:51.342
but I just typed mine and you hit enter and it will

122
00:05:51.342 --> 00:05:53.003
go ahead and install.

123
00:05:53.003 --> 00:05:55.752
I am not going to install it because I already have it.

124
00:05:55.752 --> 00:05:59.702
And the other thing that you need to do know is

125
00:05:59.702 --> 00:06:03.982
we need to create a Gulp file and the Gulp file is going

126
00:06:03.982 --> 00:06:06.939
to hold the process for what we are doing so I am gonna

127
00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:11.522
say touch gulp file.js and that's going to make a blank

128
00:06:12.803 --> 00:06:14.792
gulp file for me there.

129
00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:17.653
And then we actually need to go ahead and install a couple

130
00:06:17.653 --> 00:06:20.733
plug ins That we need so we need a local version of gulp.

131
00:06:20.733 --> 00:06:23.893
We would install as npm install gulp and we want to say

132
00:06:23.893 --> 00:06:26.963
dash dash save dev that will do is it will go off and

133
00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:31.755
install the gulp thing for us but if you go back to your

134
00:06:31.755 --> 00:06:34.897
package json you should see that gulp is added to your

135
00:06:34.897 --> 00:06:37.094
dependancies what else did we need in there?

136
00:06:37.094 --> 00:06:40.761
We actually need gulp sorry npm install gulp

137
00:06:42.995 --> 00:06:45.745
dash autoprefixer dash dash save.

138
00:06:50.235 --> 00:06:53.774
We are going to install that as well.

139
00:06:53.774 --> 00:06:56.363
There we go, its in there cool.

140
00:06:56.363 --> 00:06:57.920
We will close that down,

141
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.560
then we head into our gulp file and this is how you write

142
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.104
a gulp file.

143
00:07:02.104 --> 00:07:04.616
You say gulp equals require gulp and that's gonna

144
00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:06.686
include the entire gulp library.

145
00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:09.306
And we also need to include the plug ins we want.

146
00:07:09.306 --> 00:07:12.206
In our case we only have autoprefixer but you might have

147
00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:16.484
sas or les or whatever you are using here.

148
00:07:16.484 --> 00:07:19.019
So we will say autoprefixer equals

149
00:07:19.019 --> 00:07:19.902
require gulp

150
00:07:19.902 --> 00:07:21.402
dash autoprefixer.

151
00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:25.375
Then we are going to make a task.

152
00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:28.523
Say gulp dot task, task takes two things first is

153
00:07:28.523 --> 00:07:33.523
a name in cult style and second thing is a function to run

154
00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:37.315
so I am just going to pass in an anonymous function there.

155
00:07:37.315 --> 00:07:40.413
Next thing we need to do is go ahead and source our files.

156
00:07:40.413 --> 00:07:43.274
So the way gulp works is you go and grab contents

157
00:07:43.274 --> 00:07:45.744
of your file we will run it through our files and

158
00:07:45.744 --> 00:07:48.083
in this case just run it through autoprefixer and

159
00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:50.824
then we will kick it out the other end in another file

160
00:07:50.824 --> 00:07:53.741
called like build slash styles css.

161
00:07:57.075 --> 00:08:00.183
So we will say gulp dot src and I'm going to go into my

162
00:08:00.183 --> 00:08:05.052
css directory and styles dot css and by the way this can

163
00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:07.514
be any file if you have a different set up.

164
00:08:07.514 --> 00:08:09.864
You can always do star dot css or you could do

165
00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:13.344
star star dot css and that will grab all of them.

166
00:08:13.344 --> 00:08:16.094
It depends on how you are set up.

167
00:08:18.144 --> 00:08:20.453
I'm going to leave mine as

168
00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:21.286
Styles dot css, css styles I will type pipe.

169
00:08:21.286 --> 00:08:23.786
And the way that Gulp works is

170
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.373
you pipe the contents of the style css into

171
00:08:31.723 --> 00:08:32.806
autoprefixer.

172
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:37.939
And then once we have done that we can type pipe it

173
00:08:37.939 --> 00:08:40.938
into another one called gulp dot guest.

174
00:08:40.938 --> 00:08:45.017
And I will just pipe that into a directory called build

175
00:08:45.017 --> 00:08:47.639
or whatever you want so what that should do,

176
00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:50.320
you'll have to play around with the folders here but

177
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.153
what that should do is we should be able to go back to

178
00:08:51.153 --> 00:08:52.820
our comand line now

179
00:08:53.977 --> 00:08:58.627
and run gulp task we just created, which is styles.

180
00:08:58.627 --> 00:09:01.701
Hit enter and oh I've got an error.

181
00:09:01.701 --> 00:09:03.993
So lets see what we got here.

182
00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:06.600
css syntax error missed semi colon.

183
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.083
Oh that's nice, it's telling me I screwed up my css here.

184
00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:12.064
I am going to go look where its at

185
00:09:12.064 --> 00:09:13.515
oh there we go.

186
00:09:13.515 --> 00:09:15.750
I will try to quickly add it in later.

187
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.973
Then we go back and rerun you can hit the up arrow

188
00:09:18.973 --> 00:09:22.306
to get the most recently run task there.

189
00:09:23.652 --> 00:09:25.688
There we go, it ran it.

190
00:09:25.688 --> 00:09:28.161
I should be able to open this build directory

191
00:09:28.161 --> 00:09:31.318
and inside of that we can see styles css.

192
00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:32.151
Beautiful

193
00:09:33.518 --> 00:09:36.608
autoprefix styles have been added on there.

194
00:09:36.608 --> 00:09:40.525
So you would go to html and your link would not

195
00:09:42.283 --> 00:09:44.218
go to css styles

196
00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:47.029
css because that is your unprefixed version.

197
00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:50.915
We actually want to go into build forward slash styles.

198
00:09:50.915 --> 00:09:54.958
That should do it for us, the last thing we want to do is

199
00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.416
add what is called a watched app.

200
00:09:57.416 --> 00:09:59.598
I don't want to have to manually rerun gulp styles

201
00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.986
every time I rerun my compiler,

202
00:10:01.986 --> 00:10:03.565
I want it to do it automatically.

203
00:10:03.565 --> 00:10:05.966
So you head back to your gulp file and we will make

204
00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:10.424
another task called default and actually I will

205
00:10:10.424 --> 00:10:14.144
call it a watch there and inside of that we will pass

206
00:10:14.144 --> 00:10:16.995
another one but instead of doing a gulp dot source

207
00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:18.566
like we have been doing.

208
00:10:18.566 --> 00:10:21.664
You can do a gulp dot watch and pass it a list of css files

209
00:10:21.664 --> 00:10:26.664
in this case it's just the one that you wish to watch.

210
00:10:26.664 --> 00:10:31.164
And then when those change, you can pass it a array of

211
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:35.927
styles to run, sorry array of gulp tasks to run.

212
00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:39.137
So in our case our task name is style so we are gonna say.

213
00:10:39.137 --> 00:10:42.880
Just rerun styles whenever this file changes.

214
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.454
Now I am gonna go back here and instead of typing

215
00:10:46.454 --> 00:10:49.204
gulp styles I'll type gulp watch.

216
00:10:50.905 --> 00:10:52.685
You will notice that it doesn't kick me back to

217
00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:53.959
the command line why?

218
00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:55.470
Because it is watching it.

219
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.640
I should be able to go back to the css file and

220
00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.631
every time I save, see there we go.

221
00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:01.965
It will just save save save every time I save

222
00:11:01.965 --> 00:11:06.624
its going to rerun my styles task and going to update

223
00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.614
all of the code they have, so real quick.

224
00:11:09.614 --> 00:11:10.614
If I open up

225
00:11:13.252 --> 00:11:14.085
the build

226
00:11:16.064 --> 00:11:17.681
css,

227
00:11:17.681 --> 00:11:21.043
open it up there and I change this to 450,

228
00:11:21.043 --> 00:11:24.664
immediately you will see it has changed there.

229
00:11:24.664 --> 00:11:27.630
If I bring this one down to 360 save,

230
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.803
you see its compiled there and this one updates right away.

231
00:11:30.803 --> 00:11:35.636
Really nice clean and fast way to get our code to compile.

232
00:11:37.654 --> 00:11:39.552
So that is Gulp autoprefixer,

233
00:11:39.552 --> 00:11:42.734
definitely need that in order to support all

234
00:11:42.734 --> 00:11:46.203
the different browsers even the current browsers.

235
00:11:46.203 --> 00:11:48.054
Alright lets get into the code alongs,

236
00:11:48.054 --> 00:11:49.312
I will see you in the next video.

237
00:11:49.312 --> 00:11:51.769
(upbeat music)
