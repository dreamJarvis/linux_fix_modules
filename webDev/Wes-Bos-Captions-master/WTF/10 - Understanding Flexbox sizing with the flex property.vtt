00:00:00.294 --> 00:00:03.211
(upbeat whistling)

2
00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:13.987
<v ->Alright so, next up we are talking about</v>

3
00:00:13.987 --> 00:00:16.037
the flex property. Not display flex,

4
00:00:16.037 --> 00:00:17.538
but this is a property

5
00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:19.825
that actually goes on the individual flex item.

6
00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:20.928
Quick review.

7
00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:22.060
We've got these containers here,

8
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.795
which that's our flex container,

9
00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.200
and then each one of these things inside of here,

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.726
those are flex items.

11
00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:30.898
I switched up the content inside of them a little bit,

12
00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:32.265
just to show you the stuff works

13
00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.636
with different amounts of content.

14
00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:36.239
It's kind of nice to see some words

15
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.414
that are longer than others.

16
00:00:38.414 --> 00:00:40.072
I Just put some emojis in there

17
00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:41.719
so we can have fun.

18
00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.165
We need to go ahead and select each one.

19
00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:45.957
The property that we want

20
00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:47.461
is the flex property.

21
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:48.884
Now I'm gonna to show you how to use flex

22
00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:51.376
with just one single value first,

23
00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:53.344
then we're going to break it down

24
00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:54.949
into flex-grow, flex-shrink

25
00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.277
and something called flex-basis.

26
00:00:57.277 --> 00:00:59.015
What does flex do?

27
00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:01.309
It essentially answers the question

28
00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.142
what do I do with this extra space

29
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:08.334
or what do I do when I don't actually

30
00:01:09.263 --> 00:01:11.572
have enough space.

31
00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:13.420
Cuz the whole point of flex box is that

32
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.768
it's not gonna break you layout if

33
00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:16.878
you have too much space

34
00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:18.088
or not enough space.

35
00:01:18.088 --> 00:01:20.117
It will sort of just do

36
00:01:20.117 --> 00:01:22.046
it'll kind of intelligently

37
00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:24.413
figure out where everything needs to go.

38
00:01:24.413 --> 00:01:26.457
So what I want to do right now is like

39
00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:28.182
lets take a look here what have I done

40
00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:29.829
I just hit display flex

41
00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.493
and I've got our items

42
00:01:31.493 --> 00:01:34.608
and the width of your flex items by default

43
00:01:34.608 --> 00:01:36.282
is what's called auto.

44
00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:39.463
Its just the width of the content inside of them.

45
00:01:39.463 --> 00:01:43.963
Now if I go ahead and say flex 1 on there and refresh

46
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.075
you'll see that each of the flex items

47
00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:49.199
regardless of how much content they have

48
00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:53.208
they are all taking up the exact amount of space.

49
00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:58.208
So that answers what flex is Flex is at what proportion

50
00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:01.257
should I scale myself up or down

51
00:02:01.257 --> 00:02:05.007
when we have extra space or not enough space.

52
00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:08.779
Now because I gave all of them

53
00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.302
a flex property of 1

54
00:02:10.302 --> 00:02:12.112
remember that we're talking about

55
00:02:12.112 --> 00:02:14.156
when we don't have any flex on right here

56
00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:17.007
we're talking about the additional space

57
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:20.097
left on over or when we get smaller

58
00:02:20.097 --> 00:02:21.990
how they scaled down together.

59
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.819
talk about that in a second. So, when I say flex 1

60
00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.135
we're saying that each of you should divvy up

61
00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:31.844
the remaining space proportionately.

62
00:02:31.844 --> 00:02:33.951
And that's why they are all the same size.

63
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:37.674
However, now if I go ahead and say box 2

64
00:02:37.674 --> 00:02:41.079
and give it a flex property of 2,

65
00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.801
watch what happens to this one right here.

66
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:46.063
You see that it is twice the size

67
00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:47.272
of all the other ones.

68
00:02:47.272 --> 00:02:48.105
And why is that?

69
00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:51.635
Well, we said when there is extra space

70
00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:53.603
or when there is not enough space,

71
00:02:53.603 --> 00:02:54.608
we'll look at that in a second.

72
00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:57.696
Box 2 should have double the amount

73
00:02:57.696 --> 00:03:00.188
of all the other ones as flex 2 is just

74
00:03:00.188 --> 00:03:04.424
over-riding the flex 1 of this previously set.

75
00:03:04.424 --> 00:03:05.646
So that's great.

76
00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:08.864
When I resize, watch what happens.

77
00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:12.978
At a certain point, if I take all this off real quick

78
00:03:12.978 --> 00:03:16.061
At a certain point, right about here,

79
00:03:17.623 --> 00:03:18.986
we're gonna move from

80
00:03:18.986 --> 00:03:21.992
too much space, too much extra

81
00:03:21.992 --> 00:03:23.998
to not enough and that's

82
00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:25.923
the other thing that flex box does.

83
00:03:25.923 --> 00:03:28.016
Yeah, its great when you have extra space

84
00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:30.268
but what happens when there is

85
00:03:30.268 --> 00:03:32.757
not enough space there?

86
00:03:32.757 --> 00:03:35.860
So let me put that back on here.

87
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.311
And here, Let me show you

88
00:03:37.311 --> 00:03:39.644
what it looks like when it's just flex 1.

89
00:03:39.644 --> 00:03:42.975
There're all evenly divvied up

90
00:03:42.975 --> 00:03:45.509
but when I give box 2 a flex value of 2

91
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.078
it says all right, I'm extra hungry,

92
00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:50.643
I'm extra hungry pizza div here

93
00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:53.129
and I want to eat up twice as much

94
00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.971
of the extra room

95
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:57.017
as the rest of you.

96
00:03:57.017 --> 00:04:01.261
Now flex properties can be decimal points,

97
00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:04.928
if I were then to move dot box 5 into flex 3

98
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.458
you'll see that now box 5 takes up 3 times

99
00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:14.235
the amount of room as something that is

100
00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:17.284
still flex 1. It's all in proportion

101
00:04:17.284 --> 00:04:18.850
it's not pixels, it's not percentage

102
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.359
or anything like that. We'll be looking at that

103
00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.776
in just a second. However, it's all about

104
00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:28.081
how much of the extra space on that line

105
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:30.312
we'll at a multi-line example as well

106
00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:32.889
in just a second, How much of the extra space

107
00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.894
or when there's not enough space

108
00:04:34.894 --> 00:04:36.260
how do we divvy that up amongst

109
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.343
all of my siblings that we have here.
