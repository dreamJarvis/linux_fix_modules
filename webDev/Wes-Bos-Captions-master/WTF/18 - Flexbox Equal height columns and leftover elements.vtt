00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:02.769
(whistling)

2
00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:05.102
(whistling)

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.489
<v Instructor>Alright, in this one I wanted to do</v>

4
00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:14.969
just dead simple equal height columns

5
00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.806
and talk a little bit about what you do

6
00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:19.643
with the extra columns at the end

7
00:00:19.643 --> 00:00:20.925
once they've wrapped on.

8
00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:22.624
So, what I've got here is

9
00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:24.173
I've got div with class of elements

10
00:00:24.173 --> 00:00:26.795
and then I've got a whole bunch of divs here

11
00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:28.545
with some text in it.

12
00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:34.919
So, um, open up your style dot CSS

13
00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:37.335
and again, all this is just regular CSS

14
00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:38.999
to make it look decent.

15
00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.040
We are going to start down here.

16
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.728
So, if I want these things to go beside each other,

17
00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:46.320
I want them to be in columns

18
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.066
and I want them to be of equal height of the largest one.

19
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.350
How do we do that?

20
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.295
Well, go ahead and select the elements.

21
00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:54.011
So elements again.

22
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:56.231
This is going to be our ... you tell me.

23
00:00:56.231 --> 00:01:00.675
Flex container, good I heard you from wherever you are.

24
00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:04.842
So we'll say display ... flex, and give it a save.

25
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.253
Refresh and oh, holy smokes.

26
00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:13.760
So what it does by default is, it will put them together.

27
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.984
And how is it determining the width of these columns?

28
00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:20.025
Well, Arkansas is determining the width of these columns.

29
00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:22.560
And that's really not what we want,

30
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.528
but when you say flex, things by default are in a row

31
00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:28.407
and they will just go forever.

32
00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:30.161
They do not ... wrap.

33
00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:31.436
That's the word we're looking for.

34
00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:32.269
They do not wrap by default.

35
00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:33.561
So how do we turn wrapping on?

36
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:35.575
Well, flex, wrap, wrap.

37
00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:37.492
Give it a save and bam.

38
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:41.080
Okay, it's starting to, it's starting to wrap and

39
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.656
it's kind of interesting.

40
00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:44.521
This is something that you might want.

41
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.757
It kinda just tried to fit as many as it possibly can.

42
00:01:46.757 --> 00:01:49.529
How big are these elements here?

43
00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:53.065
They are as big as the content needs them to be.

44
00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:55.465
Sometimes you only get one on a line.

45
00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:59.153
Sometimes you get two, I don't really see any three,

46
00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:00.720
but if I were to make this bigger,

47
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.617
you'll see that you can fit

48
00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:04.217
a whole bunch of 'em on the line.

49
00:02:04.217 --> 00:02:06.497
So, that'd be kind of a cool layout for tags or something

50
00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:10.247
on a WordPress blog. However, we also want to

51
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.080
give these a width cause we wanna be able to

52
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.305
sort of fit them in as we can so,

53
00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:21.131
select the flex items. That's flex items I believe?

54
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:25.548
Yes it is, and we'll say flex one grow one shrink and

55
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.961
let's give it a 33.33% width, save and, huh

56
00:02:33.913 --> 00:02:38.442
okay-well-it's, first of all we've got our columns here

57
00:02:38.442 --> 00:02:42.145
it's working but let's put that on hold for a second.

58
00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:45.562
I said 33.33 and there's only 2 on there.

59
00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:52.025
So what's the deal here? Well since we explicitly gave it

60
00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:56.569
a width and If you look up here I gave it a margin of 10px.

61
00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.319
Again we're over budget 33 plus 33 plus 33 plus 20 pixles

62
00:03:04.073 --> 00:03:07.870
of margin on either one or over 100% budget.

63
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.265
So what we could do there is just set that to calc-20 px

64
00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:14.793
right? Cause we're gonna have 10 px on either side.

65
00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:17.698
Uh and calc is not part of the flex box.

66
00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:21.963
Is just part of CSS3 it's actuall. Can I use dot comma?

67
00:03:21.963 --> 00:03:24.081
Let's take a look. What's the support?

68
00:03:24.081 --> 00:03:26.667
Support is really good if you're using flex box

69
00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.738
Flex box doesn't work on IE9's so if you're using flex box

70
00:03:29.738 --> 00:03:32.929
you can go ahead and use calc as well.

71
00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:37.777
Calc we're gonna set to 33.33% percent minus the 20 pixels

72
00:03:37.777 --> 00:03:42.225
that we need uh and that should give us 3 per line.

73
00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:45.001
There we go. Alright so let's look what's happening here

74
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:48.505
is, this is as bare basic as you can get for equal height

75
00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:52.713
columns by default flex box will just make the column

76
00:03:52.713 --> 00:03:55.473
as high or alow as it needs to be. So this one is

77
00:03:55.473 --> 00:03:59.806
is pretty high maybe if we go in here and take these

78
00:04:01.857 --> 00:04:06.107
ones really small. So just put like 1 word in each.

79
00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:14.076
Give it a save, see look how these won't serve much

80
00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:18.419
higher than these ones it just says alright who is in my row

81
00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.169
and how tall are you and I'm going to size myself as tall

82
00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:28.514
as the highest one! So that's great um.

83
00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:32.299
If we scroll down to the bottom here you'll notice that

84
00:04:32.299 --> 00:04:36.786
we've got a number that's not easily divisible by 3 or is

85
00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:40.573
not cleanly divisible by 3 So what the browser does-says "no

86
00:04:40.573 --> 00:04:43.201
problem I'll just split up the extra area" that's the whole

87
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:48.201
point of the flex um and that's great but if you don't like

88
00:04:48.815 --> 00:04:51.936
that look we have a couple of other options we go to the

89
00:04:51.936 --> 00:04:56.595
CSS-Tricks article here and we've been dealing a lot

90
00:04:56.595 --> 00:05:01.546
with the uh align content and align item where align

91
00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:06.267
items where we go it vertically we can just do it on the

92
00:05:06.267 --> 00:05:08.547
flex end or the center and things like that.

93
00:05:08.547 --> 00:05:10.935
But we're not really concerned with vertical here we're

94
00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:14.403
concerned with horizontal and how are these items uh

95
00:05:14.403 --> 00:05:17.941
split up. So which one are we actually worried about?

96
00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:21.803
We're looking at justified content so again this goes on

97
00:05:21.803 --> 00:05:26.371
the- this is a flex container element so we're gonna go

98
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:30.138
ahead and put it on the flex container and with justified

99
00:05:30.138 --> 00:05:34.721
content um and we can do things like space between, and

100
00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:41.595
you'll notice that it- it doesn't work and the reason

101
00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:45.667
behind that is because we've told it to flex grow in this

102
00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:49.707
case we've got extra space and we've told it to evenly split

103
00:05:49.707 --> 00:05:52.938
the extra amounts to. If we change it to 0 uh what that will

104
00:05:52.938 --> 00:05:57.605
do is, in the situation where we have more space than we

105
00:05:59.146 --> 00:06:01.833
need. Which is the case.

106
00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:04.342
We previously told it to just split it up

107
00:06:04.342 --> 00:06:08.397
evenly and it did. But if we say zero do nothing with

108
00:06:08.397 --> 00:06:12.118
add the extra space now we've got this extra space on

109
00:06:12.118 --> 00:06:16.451
here uh and the items are going to go on either end.

110
00:06:18.022 --> 00:06:21.180
Let's take a look at the other ones since we've got this

111
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.130
extra space that's left over. Justified content let's us

112
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.166
do- we just did space between which it takes the extra space

113
00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:29.740
and just puts it in between and since we only have 2

114
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.020
elements here, it just puts it all in between the 2

115
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.410
elements in one big go um but we could also say things like

116
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.371
space around, which will split it between here, here and

117
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:45.371
here uh as well as flex start. Flex end you probably get the

118
00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:52.105
point here uh or I really like to do center which makes it

119
00:06:52.105 --> 00:06:55.474
look kinda neat and tidy, depending on the (inaudible)

120
00:06:55.474 --> 00:06:58.283
Um what you might be tempted to say- nah I don't like that

121
00:06:58.283 --> 00:07:01.691
let's bring it back to stretch and give it a save and

122
00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:05.226
it won't work and why not? Because stretch is not just a

123
00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:09.067
justified property you'll see it's not listed here but

124
00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:12.394
how do we do that? Well we just take justified content all

125
00:07:12.394 --> 00:07:16.059
the way off and we tell our items to grow with the extra

126
00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:19.987
space and a magnitude of one and we're off to the races and

127
00:07:19.987 --> 00:07:24.394
good to go. So again super simple um this is something that

128
00:07:24.394 --> 00:07:27.402
a lot of people need to use flex box for uh so keep this

129
00:07:27.402 --> 00:07:29.890
one handy and I'll see you in the next video!

130
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.307
