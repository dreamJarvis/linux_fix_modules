<v Instructor>Welcome back.</v>

3
00:00:13.074 --> 00:00:15.020
In this video we're gonna be talking about Flexbox ordering.

4
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.690
Which is a way to actually move

5
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.880
the order of your DOM elements

6
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.350
without actually moving them in your DOM,

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.630
which is kind of cool.

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.130
So I wanted to start just from scratch,

9
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.710
so we make sure that we're still comfortable

10
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.150
setting up Flexbox from scratch.

11
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.940
So if we look back again, make sure that

12
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.890
I've got this container which is our Flex-container.

13
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.320
And then I've got a whole bunch of boxes inside of it,

14
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.900
which are called our Flex-items.

15
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.670
So the way that we do that is we select the container.

16
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.670
Let's go ahead and say .container, display flex.

17
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.730
Give it a save.

18
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.240
Now when I refresh, you'll notice

19
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.950
that all the items are just smooshed together.

20
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.530
Then we'll go ahead and select each box.

21
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.270
Each box has a class of box on it.

22
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.180
And I'm just going to say Flex one,

23
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.380
and we haven't done that just yet, that's in a future video,

24
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.610
but essentially what that will do is, it will just evenly,

25
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.800
it'll take all the width that we have here.

26
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.250
And it will evenly distribute it amongst each other.

27
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.360
We're gonna learn a lot more about this flex property

28
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.550
and all the different arguments that we can give it.

29
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.383
But for now,

30
00:01:17.383 --> 00:01:19.820
just know that the flex one distributes equally.

31
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.653
Why am I doing that?

32
00:01:20.653 --> 00:01:22.320
Just so that this demo looks pretty nice.

33
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.570
Without it, it kind of like gets squished together.

34
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.420
And I don't want to have to get into anymore

35
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.720
width tricks than I have to.

36
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.450
I want to keep these demos as simple as possible.

37
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.380
So, we got flex one on there.

38
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.770
But let's go ahead and talk about the order properties.

39
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.880
So the order property, if you go ahead and select box three

40
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.040
it's just order.

41
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.540
So for whatever reason it's not flex order,

42
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.730
like everything else we've done so far is flex-something.

43
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.520
It's simply just order.

44
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.720
And order will take a number,

45
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.917
there's no pixels or anything like that.

46
00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:59.820
And if you give it an order let's say,

47
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.570
if I give it just five, give it a save, and refresh.

48
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.580
You'll notice that we took box three,

49
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.020
which is this purple one,

50
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.710
and it's moved all the way on to the end.

51
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.470
So what did we learn from that?

52
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.930
Well, if we give it an order of five.

53
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.470
First of all, what is one through four?

54
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.110
And let's take a look.

55
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.020
What if we just do order one, and then refresh?

56
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.190
Nothing actually happens, so that's interesting.

57
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.030
The default order

58
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.790
for everything where it is not set is zero.

59
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.390
So by default everything is set to order zero.

60
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.220
And you'll see that it's one, two, three,

61
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.550
three just gets set in there.

62
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.010
So when you go ahead and set anything to anything greater

63
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.330
than zero, like one,

64
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.580
it will then go ahead and put it on the end.

65
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.170
So it's zero, zero, zero, all the way to the end,

66
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.960
these are all zero, and one starts there.

67
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.163
So similarly, if we go to box seven.

68
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.853
Say order two,

69
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.300
it's going give us all of these,

70
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.060
one through ten.

71
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.280
These boxes right here.

72
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.960
And then we've got three and seven in the order there.

73
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.060
So if you really wanted to,

74
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.870
if this is kind of throwing you off

75
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.453
you could just say everything is order one.

76
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.160
Now everything goes on ahead.

77
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.533
And box three you could say, order three.

78
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.713
Now we've got everything is one.

79
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.090
Then box three, which is the purple one is three.

80
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.080
And seven is two so they go in that order.

81
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.120
So that's really helpful if you're,

82
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.600
especially working on like a responsive design,

83
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.433
a lot of times,

84
00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:40.404
I'll get website designs from designers and they'll say,

85
00:03:40.404 --> 00:03:42.890
This is great and then when it gets to mobile

86
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.210
let's just totally change how everything looks.

87
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.500
And you say well I can't really do that

88
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.810
because they way the html is written

89
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.930
is kind of the order that it shows up.

90
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.720
We've got a few tricks you can do positioning

91
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.680
or floating things left and right.

92
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.060
But if you want to totally change the order,

93
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.610
like if you want to take this number three,

94
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.870
and just take it all the way out,

95
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.360
and maybe put it in the footer of a website.

96
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.090
Then you don't really have an option until now

97
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.250
that we have Flexbox.

98
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.710
And that's when you could use order.

99
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.400
What happens if we make something negative?

100
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.970
Negative let's try box three, order negative one.

101
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.280
Give it a save.

102
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.550
What you'll see is it also does work negatively.

103
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.670
I make box seven negative two,

104
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.870
it's going to negative two, negative one.

105
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.890
The rest of them are one because I put it here.

106
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.520
Or I take this off the rest of them are zero.

107
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.210
So it worked kind of like Z index, there's no units,

108
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.040
it just kind of figures out what order every things is in.

109
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.140
And we'll set them in.

110
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.180
The really one caveat that we have here

111
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.573
if I just make this order one.

112
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.970
Is that if I try and use my selector here.

113
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.630
So I'm just selecting one, selecting two,

114
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.540
and then I'm gonna try to select four.

115
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.610
Look what happens, right.

116
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.810
I hover over four, and then one, two, and then three

117
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.460
is selected with my thing.

118
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.920
If I keep going a little bit further

119
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.020
it's gonna select four.

120
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.870
Let's get one more out of there.

121
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.010
So box five order two,

122
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.530
that should put it right at the end there.

123
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.023
So one, two, three is now selected.

124
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.220
One, two, three, four, five, so like if you trying to

125
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.430
actually copy some text off of it.

126
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.010
Like let's say I wanted to copy one, four, two, and one.

127
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.720
And then I went into here and pasted it.

128
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.930
I actually get one, two, three, and four.

129
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.640
So it's not to be used for things where you need

130
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.970
people to copy text.

131
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.810
Because that's gonna make them really frustrated.

132
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.100
But generally, that's not what you're doing.

133
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.080
You're not like ordering paragraph tags.

134
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.770
You probably have like a layout item where there might be

135
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.840
header, footer, about, contact, products.

136
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.673
Where you're just kind of

137
00:05:51.673 --> 00:05:53.350
changing the order at which they come in.

138
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.670
So, that's order.

139
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.000
We will see you in the next video

140
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.523
where we're gonna talk about alignment.

141
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.530
I think that's what a lot of people are here to learn.

142
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.210
Where you've got all these boxes,

143
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.460
how do you have a little bit of fine grade control over

144
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.350
aligning and centering

145
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.350
and justifying content of all the items?

146
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.142
So see you in the next video!

147
00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:14.127
