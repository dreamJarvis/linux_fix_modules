<v Instructor>Hello everyone, Wes here,</v>

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.500
I wanted to chat about using flexbox and forms together.

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.800
I was on the Airbnb website the other day

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.950
and they got this really little, simple, bar

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.783
that you can use.

7
00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:24.690
So it's got a place where you can

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.770
search where you want, how you can check in, check out,

9
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.630
select the number of guests, and hit your search button.

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.370
So, I thought that would be kind of neat to recreate,

11
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.460
we could have done this with floats and widths

12
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.800
and stuff like that however it's nice to be able to

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.830
throw your forms with a whole bunch of inputs

14
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.940
and have them just kind of perfectly fit together

15
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.640
without having to worry about how wide are things,

16
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.473
and things like that.

17
00:00:47.473 --> 00:00:52.473
So, I've got this sort of demo up and running,

18
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.460
it might not work perfectly on all the other browsers

19
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.020
but the parts that might not work are just

20
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.040
the video and the input type of date,

21
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.080
that's really not to matter, we're more worried

22
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.850
about getting these actual alignment things up and running.

23
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.940
I grabbed this video from Coverr,

24
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.350
if you've never checked out Coverr, it's coverr.co

25
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.740
awesome little website where they give you,

26
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.880
just free autoplaying, you videos.

27
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.500
So, I've got this as ANSWER,

28
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.580
it's what we're going to be building,

29
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.250
but I'm going to change it to,

30
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.640
just where we're starting off.

31
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.870
So, here we go, this is kind of where we start off,

32
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.580
we've got our inputs, they're not all the same sizes,

33
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.370
they are kind of a little bit weird and we've got all these,

34
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.160
this is called like a ghost space because inputs are

35
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.130
inline by default they'll just put some space in between,

36
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.700
which can be a bit of a pain when you're trying to

37
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.750
align them all.

38
00:01:45.684 --> 00:01:47.180
HTML, what does that look like?

39
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.610
We've got a div with a class of cover,

40
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.160
and that is set to just kind of span the entire browser,

41
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.520
it's a 100vh and a 100vw each way.

42
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.130
Then I got a form with the class of flex-form

43
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.190
and inside of that I've got my inputs, my labels,

44
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.500
my dropdowns, sort of everything that I would need.

45
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.510
Let's get up and running with that,

46
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.230
jump into style.css and we are going to go ahead

47
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.680
and start with our flexbox.

48
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.130
The first thing I want to do,

49
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.780
is to actually get this form here center, so I want it both

50
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.090
vertically center and horizontally center,

51
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.470
so we'll select .cover which is again

52
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.430
that's the whole thing,

53
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.460
and we'll set it to flex,

54
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.410
so flex, give that a save, and it doesn't do too much,

55
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.220
just because we really only have,

56
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.810
one item inside of it, but we can use flexbox

57
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.440
to align it both horizontally as well as vertically.

58
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.750
So first let's do the horizontal and if we want

59
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.170
to horizontally center something,

60
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.030
that is on our main access, which is left to right,

61
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.950
and for that we can use justify-content:center.

62
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.550
Make sure you spell it right, give it a save and bam,

63
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.260
there we go, our form is now centered left to right,

64
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.720
and then we want it to also vertically be centered in

65
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.890
the middle of this cover div,

66
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.800
so for that we'll use align-items:center.

67
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.030
There we go, it's perfectly centered, bam,

68
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.820
right inside in the middle of the browser,

69
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.220
and that's great, so we'll move on from cover

70
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.720
on to the actual form itself.

71
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.716
So, this is a flex item right now, but we're again we're

72
00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:37.620
gonna do the same thing what we did in previous videos,

73
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.390
is also make it a flex container, so go ahead and select it,

74
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.150
and we will say, display:flex

75
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.940
and what that does for us

76
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.510
is it makes it flexible, and the cool thing about that,

77
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.690
right away, by saying display:flex,

78
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.003
what happens?

79
00:04:00.003 --> 00:04:01.650
Well it starts to look a lot better,

80
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.790
because it takes everything, now that flex form

81
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.400
is a flex container, the input, the label, the input,

82
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.830
the label, the input, the select, and the input,

83
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.810
those are all of our flex items, and by default,

84
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.150
it's going to stretch it across, it's going to evenly

85
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.150
make all of these things, the exact same size for us,

86
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.610
which is fantastic to do.

87
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.820
What else do we need to do on there?

88
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.680
We'll put a quick border on it,

89
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.220
so border:20px solid rgba(0,0,0,0).

90
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.797
Put a border-radius on it, something like 5px,

91
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.980
and alright, that's looking good to me.

92
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.760
So that's pretty much it so far, but we just got

93
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.610
the issue of this one input right here,

94
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.850
not being big enough, that's sort of just the default size

95
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.210
that we have, and before you reach for your width in CSS,

96
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.050
let's actually go ahead and select it

97
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.170
and use our flex-basis.

98
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.560
So how do we select that one?

99
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.520
It looks like it's an intput with the type of search,

100
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.390
so we can go down here and say input[type="search"]

101
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.390
and we'll say, flex-basis set to 500px, let's see.

102
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.570
So ideally in an ideal world

103
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.060
we'd have that input as a 500px.

104
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.440
So refresh, and we're off to the races.

105
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.860
So that, that seemed really easy,

106
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.100
this is a pretty short video,

107
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.290
really all we did is one, two, three, four, five,

108
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.950
different flexbox, or six different flexbox properties,

109
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.580
and that's kind of the beauty of flexbox is that when

110
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.760
you actually know what you're doing with all these different

111
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.320
properties, you can quickly slap something together

112
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.220
which previously might take a lot of math

113
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.760
and a lot of manual alignment.

114
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.660
Alright, I will see you in the next video.

115
