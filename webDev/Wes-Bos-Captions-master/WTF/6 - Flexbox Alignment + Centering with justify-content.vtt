00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:13.138
<v Wes Bos>Alright, welcome to the</v>

3
00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:14.546
alignment and centering videos.

4
00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:16.517
If you've made it this far, congratulations.

5
00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:18.872
I know that sometimes, it's tempting to just say,

6
00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:22.181
I'll just do these tutorials later, but, um,

7
00:00:22.181 --> 00:00:24.118
these videos are short and to the point on purpose

8
00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:26.141
and I'd love to hear, uh, how far you've made it

9
00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:27.337
and how you're feeling about it.

10
00:00:27.337 --> 00:00:29.448
Uh, just tweet at me, I'm @Wesbos.

11
00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:32.208
Wesbos. Just tweet at me and say,

12
00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:34.325
Hey, I've made it to the alignment and centering videos

13
00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.642
and, uh, let me know what you're thinking of it.

14
00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:39.138
So, uh, alignment and centering, the next four videos.

15
00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:40.789
I think this is kind of the meat and potatoes of

16
00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.437
flexboxes are some of the more important, uh,

17
00:00:44.437 --> 00:00:46.485
parts of flexbox and I think stuff that

18
00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:48.456
you're actually coming here, uh, to learn.

19
00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:51.101
So, uh, what I've done here, is I'm just

20
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:53.685
in the alignment and centering, uh, html here,

21
00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:56.597
but we've got still the same container and

22
00:00:56.597 --> 00:00:58.490
flex items that we're talking about.

23
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.677
Um, and I've just said display flex on the container.

24
00:01:01.677 --> 00:01:03.277
So, nothing else, nothing else.

25
00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:05.095
If you've got anything else in there, uh,

26
00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:06.349
make sure you get rid of that.

27
00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:08.269
I just want the very basics.

28
00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:10.552
So, uh, the other thing I want you to do is go to the

29
00:01:10.552 --> 00:01:12.906
CSS-TRICKS article on

30
00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:16.167
Flexbox and uh, this is a great reference for uh,

31
00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:18.874
everything that is in Flexbox and we are going

32
00:01:18.874 --> 00:01:22.631
to be starting with, uh, justify-content.

33
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:26.922
So, what is justify-content? Justify-content says,

34
00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:31.669
how are the items aligned on the main axis? Now hold on.

35
00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:33.276
What's the main axis again?

36
00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:36.507
Remember when we talked about that in a video before.

37
00:01:36.507 --> 00:01:40.718
The main axis by default, is from left to right

38
00:01:40.718 --> 00:01:42.498
across the screen from your left to right

39
00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:43.957
and the, what's this one called again?

40
00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:45.390
Where it goes top to bottom, top to bottom?

41
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.341
That's the cross axis, good. Great job.

42
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.080
Uh, so, we aren't concerned with

43
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.262
vertically centering right now, uh,

44
00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:55.278
we are, well I shouldn't say vertically centered, cause

45
00:01:55.278 --> 00:01:57.652
if the, they switch, then we would we'll look at that in a

46
00:01:57.652 --> 00:02:00.768
second but, we are only concerned about, how are these items

47
00:02:00.768 --> 00:02:03.745
here, aligned on the main axis, which,

48
00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:06.146
right now, is from left to right.

49
00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:07.801
So, let's go ahead

50
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:08.634
and

51
00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:13.094
go into CSS and we will say, justify-content.

52
00:02:13.094 --> 00:02:17.254
Now, justify-content has a number of different options.

53
00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:19.859
Uh, we have flex-start which is the default.

54
00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.368
So, if I say flex-start, refresh, nothing happens.

55
00:02:22.368 --> 00:02:24.345
That's because, the items are aligned

56
00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:26.893
to the start of the flex container, right?

57
00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:29.920
So, uh, again, left to right they start here.

58
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.261
You probably figured out that we also have flex-end.

59
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:36.004
Which means that the flex container is,

60
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:37.954
you can't really see it right now, but if I say,

61
00:02:37.954 --> 00:02:39.754
border 10px,

62
00:02:39.754 --> 00:02:41.179
solid

63
00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:42.580
mistyrose,

64
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.934
best color ever, you'll see that this is the flex container.

65
00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:48.033
It's kind of going all around here

66
00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:49.704
with this little pink border.

67
00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:52.607
So, it starts on the right hand side cause

68
00:02:52.607 --> 00:02:55.690
that's the end of our flex container.

69
00:02:56.886 --> 00:03:00.345
What else do we have there? We've got center.

70
00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:01.957
Give it a save, refresh, and

71
00:03:01.957 --> 00:03:03.532
it will just align it's center there.

72
00:03:03.532 --> 00:03:05.391
We don't have to do any merging tricks or

73
00:03:05.391 --> 00:03:07.199
anything that doesn't really makes sense,

74
00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.869
It actually just makes the sense to say

75
00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:13.816
justify-content, uh, we've got one called space-between,

76
00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:17.537
which, this is kind of cool. So, right now,

77
00:03:17.537 --> 00:03:20.224
before I did any of that,

78
00:03:20.224 --> 00:03:22.697
our items are just as wide as the amount of content.

79
00:03:22.697 --> 00:03:23.894
So most of them are just as wide as

80
00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:25.283
the single number except for ten.

81
00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:26.243
It's a little bit different.

82
00:03:26.243 --> 00:03:28.285
And in a future video, we are going to be looking at,

83
00:03:28.285 --> 00:03:29.885
uh, the flex property which will allow you

84
00:03:29.885 --> 00:03:32.099
to divvy the space up, however,

85
00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.519
if you don't have that, or if you

86
00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.681
have maybe put a width on them,

87
00:03:36.681 --> 00:03:39.043
uh, or you just have a natural width on them,

88
00:03:39.043 --> 00:03:40.438
which is the case right now,

89
00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:43.077
If you say space between, it's just gonna start the

90
00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:46.783
first one at the flex-start, the last one at the flex-end,

91
00:03:46.783 --> 00:03:48.491
and it's just gonna divvy up the rest of

92
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:49.938
the space in between each one.

93
00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.639
It's really nice because, if you're doing this

94
00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.244
with floats, you'd have to do a whole bunch of

95
00:03:55.244 --> 00:03:57.582
different math to be able to figure out, alright,

96
00:03:57.582 --> 00:04:00.253
I have ten items, but I only have nine spaces in between,

97
00:04:00.253 --> 00:04:03.690
then how do I work all of that out with margins?

98
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.766
So, space-between, um, we also have space-around.

99
00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:08.697
So what's the difference between

100
00:04:08.697 --> 00:04:11.801
space-between and space-around? Maybe think about it

101
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.747
real quick, 3, 2, 1, refresh.

102
00:04:13.747 --> 00:04:15.136
Okay, so what just happened there is,

103
00:04:15.136 --> 00:04:18.758
uh, it also took into account the spacing

104
00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.262
on the left and the right.

105
00:04:20.262 --> 00:04:22.711
So, sometimes when you're making grid or a column or

106
00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:24.778
something like that, you don't want space on

107
00:04:24.778 --> 00:04:26.808
the left and the right which is why you have to figure out

108
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.497
that you have to space it in between them.

109
00:04:28.497 --> 00:04:31.180
Um, but space-around will give it use space on

110
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.296
the left and the right.

111
00:04:33.296 --> 00:04:35.140
How come the space right here looks to be

112
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.737
only about quite a bit less than this one here?

113
00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.388
Uh, is it because of the border?

114
00:04:40.388 --> 00:04:43.038
Or, is it because of something else?

115
00:04:43.038 --> 00:04:46.629
It's because, on this one, one on the right hand has

116
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.175
some space and two on the left hand has some space.

117
00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:52.096
So, it's not actually, perfectly centered like that,

118
00:04:52.096 --> 00:04:54.935
even if you take the border off, uh, you'll see that

119
00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:57.652
this space is only half of what we have there.

120
00:04:57.652 --> 00:04:59.943
So, those are all of them. Again, we got

121
00:04:59.943 --> 00:05:01.761
flex-start, which is at the start,

122
00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:05.249
flex-end at the end, center pops them right in the middle,

123
00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:07.527
and we've got space-between and space-around

124
00:05:07.527 --> 00:05:10.529
which do, uh, a number of different

125
00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.787
divvying up of the less the available space.

126
00:05:14.787 --> 00:05:17.149
Now, let's roll a quick talk about, uh,

127
00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:20.171
switching around the flex direction because

128
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:22.677
uh, I'm really stressing that our main axis is

129
00:05:22.677 --> 00:05:25.647
from left to right and our cross axis is from top to bottom.

130
00:05:25.647 --> 00:05:28.496
However, we learned in the previous video that when you

131
00:05:28.496 --> 00:05:30.746
go ahead and change that, so if I default

132
00:05:30.746 --> 00:05:32.210
the flex direction is set to,

133
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.633
what, you tell me? Correct, it is set to row by default.

134
00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:37.816
So, that's not going to do anything, but

135
00:05:37.816 --> 00:05:40.464
if I changed it to column,

136
00:05:40.464 --> 00:05:42.649
you give it a save and refresh,

137
00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:45.132
like, it's just totally different and

138
00:05:45.132 --> 00:05:48.544
this is generally where people get confused as to flexbox

139
00:05:48.544 --> 00:05:50.464
because you changed it to column and all of a sudden

140
00:05:50.464 --> 00:05:52.940
all of that really nice spacing is gone.

141
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.416
Um, and the reason why this is happening

142
00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:59.408
is because of two things. First of all, how high

143
00:05:59.408 --> 00:06:02.190
is this container here? I'm gonna put this border

144
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.323
back on and refresh. How high is it?

145
00:06:04.323 --> 00:06:06.660
Well, this border goes all the way down.

146
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.229
It's really just as high as the content needs to go.

147
00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.513
uh, and, if you made this content any bigger or smaller

148
00:06:12.513 --> 00:06:15.931
it would just kind of go ahead on up and down with it.

149
00:06:15.931 --> 00:06:19.981
So, for us to actually take advantage of justify-content,

150
00:06:19.981 --> 00:06:22.905
when we switch the main axis

151
00:06:22.905 --> 00:06:26.789
from row, which is left to right, to

152
00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.430
column, which is top to bottom, is we need to

153
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.771
actually give this container a height. So I'm just gonna

154
00:06:31.771 --> 00:06:34.479
go ahead and say, min-height: 100vh like we

155
00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:36.911
did in the past videos and that will set a

156
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:40.463
fixed height on the, or at least a minimum fixed height

157
00:06:40.463 --> 00:06:42.599
on there. Refresh, that does nothing. Why?

158
00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:45.141
Because, these are way to big for it.

159
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:46.741
It's actually spilling on out of it.

160
00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:49.494
So, uh, how do we make these items a little bit smaller

161
00:06:49.494 --> 00:06:51.477
so we can actually visualize that? Now let's go back to here

162
00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:54.849
and choose these to twenty, does that work? Perfect! So,

163
00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:55.766
now, we are

164
00:06:57.493 --> 00:06:59.810
still on justify-content space-around,

165
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.635
but, let me, uh, change that back to flex-start.

166
00:07:03.635 --> 00:07:06.611
Okay, so now our flex container is this

167
00:07:06.611 --> 00:07:11.270
pink border here. It goes all the way down into the bottom

168
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.041
and, we are at the flex-start, which,

169
00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:16.345
instead of going left to right because the

170
00:07:16.345 --> 00:07:18.336
main axis was left to right, now our

171
00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:21.344
main axis is top to bottom, it's going to start at the top

172
00:07:21.344 --> 00:07:22.739
so you'll probably figure out what happens when

173
00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:26.368
we make it flex-end, it starts them at the bottom

174
00:07:26.368 --> 00:07:31.368
and goes on up, uh, same goes for if we change it to center.

175
00:07:32.524 --> 00:07:35.863
And there, that's the big kahuna everyone wants to know.

176
00:07:35.863 --> 00:07:39.321
How do I vertically center something with flexbox? And that

177
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:41.587
is one of the ways. We're gonna look at a couple more,

178
00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:43.445
uh, ways that might not set,

179
00:07:43.445 --> 00:07:45.060
cause you might not want columns in your case,

180
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.760
you still might want to stick with your rows.

181
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.038
Uh, but that's definitely one of them,

182
00:07:49.038 --> 00:07:51.880
uh, again, space-between,

183
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.213
better, between.

184
00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:56.775
You're gonna see the space-between. Similarly, space-around

185
00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:59.273
is gonna give you some space at the top and the bottom.

186
00:07:59.273 --> 00:08:01.653
So, again. When you're doing this stuff, just always stop.

187
00:08:01.653 --> 00:08:06.011
Ask yourself, where is my main axis? Where is my cross axis?

188
00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:09.064
Tell me right now, where's our main axis? Top to bottom.

189
00:08:09.064 --> 00:08:11.252
Where's our cross axis? Left to right.

190
00:08:11.252 --> 00:08:13.921
So, okay, that's good. In the next video we're

191
00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:17.697
going to be looking at a line items. Uh, which is,

192
00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:20.199
uh, sort of the flip-flop of this. Um,

193
00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.734
instead of working the main axis,

194
00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:24.846
we're working on the cross axis.

195
00:08:24.846 --> 00:08:27.013
So, see you in that video.
