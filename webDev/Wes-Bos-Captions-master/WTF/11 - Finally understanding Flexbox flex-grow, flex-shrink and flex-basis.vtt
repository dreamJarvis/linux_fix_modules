00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:05.352
(energetic music)

2
00:00:12.318 --> 00:00:13.481
<v Narrator>Alright, and the last video we talked</v>

3
00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:17.319
about just a simple flex property in which that

4
00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:20.247
when you have extra space or when things get cut down,

5
00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:23.296
you don't have enough space, how will things

6
00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:26.376
distribute the extra space or chop themselves down

7
00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:28.287
when you have not enough space

8
00:00:28.287 --> 00:00:30.529
and we were actually going ahead

9
00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.439
and just using the flex property

10
00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:35.677
and setting it to things like one and two

11
00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:38.759
and what that essentially means and we should be using this

12
00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:41.682
but by one we actually have three properties

13
00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:44.879
that are packed into this one property.

14
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.928
There is something called flex-grow.

15
00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:51.095
There's another one called flex-shrink

16
00:00:52.437 --> 00:00:55.634
and we have a third one called flex-basis.

17
00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:59.026
Now what flex-grow is, is essentially

18
00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:03.603
when we have extra space, how should we divide it

19
00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:06.792
amongst everybody on the same line.

20
00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:11.040
So what I'm gonna do here is if I take

21
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.678
that flex off, I go into a box

22
00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:18.481
and I just say flex-grow one and refresh.

23
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:20.962
That's exactly what we're doing before.

24
00:01:20.962 --> 00:01:25.283
And we are also doing something called flex-shrink one.

25
00:01:25.283 --> 00:01:28.244
So again, if you set flex to be one,

26
00:01:28.244 --> 00:01:30.942
what it does is it's a shorthand

27
00:01:30.942 --> 00:01:34.134
for setting flex-grow to one and flex-shrink to one.

28
00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:37.844
So flex-grow is pretty easy to understand.

29
00:01:37.844 --> 00:01:40.913
I think that when you have extra space,

30
00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:43.384
how much extra should it take?

31
00:01:43.384 --> 00:01:44.737
But before we get into these too much,

32
00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.969
we actually need to look at the third one

33
00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.257
which is called flex-basis.

34
00:01:49.257 --> 00:01:51.718
And essentially what flex-basis is,

35
00:01:51.718 --> 00:01:56.057
in an ideal world, before we start growing and shrinking

36
00:01:56.057 --> 00:01:59.718
before we start taking the extra space and allotting it

37
00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:04.639
between all of our flex items, how big should it be?

38
00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:07.805
How wide should the actual element be?

39
00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:10.515
Or how high should the element be

40
00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:13.344
if we are switching our access again,

41
00:02:13.344 --> 00:02:15.256
our main access is left to right,

42
00:02:15.256 --> 00:02:17.987
cross access is top to bottom.

43
00:02:17.987 --> 00:02:21.917
So let's actually I've just made this super simple example

44
00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:24.987
cause this is a little bit hard to follow along with.

45
00:02:24.987 --> 00:02:29.236
If you open up the flex-grow in trunk one

46
00:02:29.236 --> 00:02:34.236
and I'm just gonna go ahead and select box one

47
00:02:34.422 --> 00:02:39.005
and I wanna say flex-basis

48
00:02:40.346 --> 00:02:42.003
let's do 400 pX

49
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:46.609
and same for box two let's do that.

50
00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.604
So let's just go ahead and say here

51
00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:53.897
in an ideal world each of these boxes

52
00:02:53.897 --> 00:02:57.950
would be 400 pixels wide assuming that the rapper

53
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.738
or the container is going to be 800.

54
00:03:02.738 --> 00:03:06.737
So and I refresh there, and I inspect these elements here,

55
00:03:06.737 --> 00:03:11.552
you'll see that this one

56
00:03:11.552 --> 00:03:14.512
is through 400 pixels wide and that one is 400 pixels wide.

57
00:03:14.512 --> 00:03:16.902
So take note that that's 380, how come?

58
00:03:16.902 --> 00:03:19.822
because it got 10 padding and 10 on the other side.`

59
00:03:19.822 --> 00:03:24.313
So in an ideal world that is 400 by 400,

60
00:03:24.313 --> 00:03:27.654
and that's great except the question is,

61
00:03:27.654 --> 00:03:30.054
what happens when we have extra room

62
00:03:30.054 --> 00:03:31.754
which is where our flex-grow comes in.

63
00:03:31.754 --> 00:03:34.518
In this case, we do have extra room.

64
00:03:34.518 --> 00:03:36.431
Where should that extra room go?

65
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:38.909
Should one or two, how should they divvy

66
00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.332
it up between the two of them?

67
00:03:40.332 --> 00:03:45.332
So on box one, we can go ahead and say

68
00:03:45.577 --> 00:03:50.577
flex-grow and let's just say one and see what that does.

69
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.364
So what do you think should happen

70
00:03:53.364 --> 00:03:56.795
if you've set flux-grow on this guy

71
00:03:56.795 --> 00:03:59.424
to one and then nothing on this one?

72
00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:01.894
Refresh, well that's interesting.

73
00:04:01.894 --> 00:04:05.195
So what happened there is that

74
00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:08.691
we didn't apply anything on box two for flex-grow.

75
00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:13.691
And if we inspect it, see, look, it's still 400 pixels wide

76
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.763
and then box one just ate up the rest of it.

77
00:04:17.763 --> 00:04:21.851
So what that tells us is the default flex-grow

78
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:24.454
for anything is zero essentially it means

79
00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:27.763
when there is extra room don't do anything

80
00:04:27.763 --> 00:04:29.643
which is essentially the default.

81
00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:32.083
When if we don't put flux-grow on anything,

82
00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:34.094
when there is extra room don't do anything

83
00:04:34.094 --> 00:04:37.948
just stay at your ideal space.

84
00:04:37.948 --> 00:04:39.940
However, we're not really that interested in that

85
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.940
because we wanna go ahead and put a grow on it.

86
00:04:45.148 --> 00:04:47.945
I'll just put a one on each of them

87
00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:49.761
and that's not going to do much

88
00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:51.830
because it's getting evenly distributed.

89
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.830
However, now if I take this box one and make it

90
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.750
let's just do two I'm gonna put my cursor

91
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.121
where the middle is, I refresh,

92
00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:05.391
you see that it moved to the right just a little bit more

93
00:05:05.391 --> 00:05:08.942
because now box one is getting twice as much

94
00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:11.681
of the extra room as box two.

95
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:14.534
Now where this is really noticeable

96
00:05:14.534 --> 00:05:18.612
as if you make flux-grow like something like 10,

97
00:05:18.612 --> 00:05:19.991
now one is getting 10 times

98
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:23.391
the amount of extra space that two is.

99
00:05:23.391 --> 00:05:27.681
So that's great and if I open up my dev tools here,

100
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:32.402
and I go ahead and resize my browser,

101
00:05:32.402 --> 00:05:33.752
you'll see in the top right hand corner,

102
00:05:33.752 --> 00:05:36.179
it's telling us exactly how wide my browser is.

103
00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:40.594
So right now it's 1400 each pixels wide.

104
00:05:40.594 --> 00:05:43.718
So that's great because we've got extra room,

105
00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:46.301
extra room 400 plus 400 is 800.

106
00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:49.672
And we've got all kinds of extra space there.

107
00:05:49.672 --> 00:05:53.963
But what happens if I then bring

108
00:05:53.963 --> 00:05:58.963
my browser down to let's go to 800 pixels

109
00:05:59.105 --> 00:06:00.993
okay, look us in spectrum real quick.

110
00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.702
Okay, they're both 400.

111
00:06:02.702 --> 00:06:04.930
So this is where flex-basis kicks in.

112
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.277
They're both, ideally 400 pixels.

113
00:06:07.277 --> 00:06:10.831
But now my question is, what happens

114
00:06:10.831 --> 00:06:14.253
when we go under 400 pixels

115
00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:16.986
You'll notice that in regular flows

116
00:06:16.986 --> 00:06:19.049
it just break on to the next line,

117
00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:22.684
but in this case, they sort of start just

118
00:06:22.684 --> 00:06:25.114
chopping themselves down a little bit,

119
00:06:25.114 --> 00:06:28.065
because we don't have any sort of wrapping

120
00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:30.412
turned on with flex box just yet.

121
00:06:30.412 --> 00:06:33.663
So that's where flex-shrink comes in.

122
00:06:33.663 --> 00:06:37.019
So if flex-grow is how do we deal

123
00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:39.438
with the extra space available to us,

124
00:06:39.438 --> 00:06:44.438
flex-shrink is how do we sort of slim ourselves down

125
00:06:44.814 --> 00:06:48.613
when there really isn't enough space for all of us.

126
00:06:48.613 --> 00:06:50.122
So again, ideally, it'd be 400,

127
00:06:50.122 --> 00:06:54.282
but we really just don't have the pixels to do that.

128
00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:57.852
So how should we kind of slim ourselves down?

129
00:06:57.852 --> 00:07:00.397
So, I gonna go ahead and

130
00:07:00.397 --> 00:07:02.981
the default flex_shrink is one.

131
00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:07.210
So you'll notice that if I bring it really skinny here,

132
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.474
you'll notice that that one is 279 and that one also 279.

133
00:07:11.474 --> 00:07:14.282
So the default for flexbox is that

134
00:07:14.282 --> 00:07:17.885
when there's not enough room just evenly divided

135
00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:19.877
amongst yourselves and everyone's happy

136
00:07:19.877 --> 00:07:22.279
however, we might not want that.

137
00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:26.279
So what we can go ahead and say is flex-shrink,

138
00:07:27.904 --> 00:07:29.910
and I'm gonna put an outrageous number right on here

139
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.147
and say, 10 again, and refresh.

140
00:07:33.147 --> 00:07:36.930
So let's go back down to our 800, okay here.

141
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.862
And then here we go watch what starts to happen.

142
00:07:39.862 --> 00:07:40.875
Oh, interesting.

143
00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:43.708
So we put a flex-shrink

144
00:07:44.574 --> 00:07:46.690
on one of 10

145
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.440
and two, the second box does not,

146
00:07:50.942 --> 00:07:53.134
it takes up way more room than that.

147
00:07:53.134 --> 00:07:55.500
So what that tells us about flex-shrink

148
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.957
is it's a number as to how much of myself

149
00:07:59.957 --> 00:08:02.957
should I give up in proportion to the other one.

150
00:08:02.957 --> 00:08:05.452
So you'll notice that box two doesn't have flex-shrink,

151
00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:08.250
but again, the default is one.

152
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.659
So when we have not enough room,

153
00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:16.693
I'm going to shrink myself 10 times more than box two.

154
00:08:16.693 --> 00:08:21.133
Now that's a bell radius, you might do something like five,

155
00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:23.783
I'm gonna shrink myself five times

156
00:08:23.783 --> 00:08:27.820
less or more than a box two refresh,

157
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.476
you'll see there so two gets it.

158
00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:33.842
And that's really handy and responsive design.

159
00:08:33.842 --> 00:08:35.773
If you've got a content in a sidebar,

160
00:08:35.773 --> 00:08:37.318
where if you've got the space,

161
00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:39.355
you can do really nice design.

162
00:08:39.355 --> 00:08:41.926
When you're in your kind of ideal scenario,

163
00:08:41.926 --> 00:08:43.758
you can split it up evenly.

164
00:08:43.758 --> 00:08:45.552
And then once you get really small,

165
00:08:45.552 --> 00:08:46.471
you can sort of say, all right,

166
00:08:46.471 --> 00:08:48.177
this is how you should handle it.

167
00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:49.908
And we're not dealing with floats

168
00:08:49.908 --> 00:08:54.253
we're not dealing with any sort of adding up ,

169
00:08:54.253 --> 00:08:55.967
you know in floats, you need to make sure

170
00:08:55.967 --> 00:08:57.875
that you always hit 100%.

171
00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:00.549
in this case I'm going ahead and I'm using pixels,

172
00:09:00.549 --> 00:09:04.429
you can use arms or remes or really anything you want.

173
00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:07.245
So that's flex-basis, grow and shrink.

174
00:09:07.245 --> 00:09:11.213
Now you probably will never go ahead and write directors.

175
00:09:11.213 --> 00:09:15.349
Because we want to use the property just simply flex.

176
00:09:15.349 --> 00:09:19.637
So, say flex, we first say the grow,

177
00:09:19.637 --> 00:09:24.408
then we say the shrink and then we say the basis

178
00:09:24.408 --> 00:09:27.158
and that's in a nice single line.

179
00:09:27.158 --> 00:09:31.668
And then we'll go ahead and do this one as well.

180
00:09:31.668 --> 00:09:36.668
Flex is going to be 114 hundred PX

181
00:09:36.697 --> 00:09:38.616
and we do it all in one go.

182
00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:41.083
So even if you're not going to be setting the basis

183
00:09:41.083 --> 00:09:43.027
like if you just do something like that,

184
00:09:43.027 --> 00:09:44.115
or even like we did before

185
00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:46.027
you decided to set it to simply one.

186
00:09:46.027 --> 00:09:49.475
It's recommended that you set it in the shorthand

187
00:09:49.475 --> 00:09:51.715
because the browser is going to kind of

188
00:09:51.715 --> 00:09:56.107
look at your layout and intelligently figure out

189
00:09:56.107 --> 00:09:59.185
how big these two other ones should be.

190
00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:00.187
Which is kind of cool.

191
00:10:00.187 --> 00:10:01.686
You give up a little bit of control

192
00:10:01.686 --> 00:10:04.566
that you might be used to setting hard widths

193
00:10:04.566 --> 00:10:07.206
and floats with your regular CSS.

194
00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:09.907
But that's the beauty of flexbox.

195
00:10:09.907 --> 00:10:12.740
(energetic music)
