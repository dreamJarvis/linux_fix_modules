1
00:00:00.051 --> 00:00:02.634
(bright music)

2
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.149
<v ->Alright, in this one we are going to talk about</v>

3
00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.440
re-ordering when you hit a certain breakpoint,

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.949
and the most kinda common use case for something like this

5
00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.920
is when you have your desktop view and when

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.259
you're going down to mobile or vice versa,

7
00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.240
and you want to re-order the items that are on the page.

8
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.059
So rather than taking them out of the DOM

9
00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.779
and spin them back in, we can use the flexbox order

10
00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:34.189
to get up and running.

11
00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:36.379
So just a quick little look as to

12
00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.712
what we'll be building here.

13
00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:41.411
Just got a simple little website here

14
00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:43.339
and let's take a look at the HTML first.

15
00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.011
So I've sort of broken it down into sections,

16
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:49.131
which is generally how your website is going to be.

17
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:52.400
And we're just going to be re-ordering each in a second,

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.989
so I've just got a wrapper here which is

19
00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.829
gonna serve as our flex container.

20
00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.000
I've got a header, which I've just sort of put

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.026
these backgrounds on each of them.

22
00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:03.179
This is the nav from the previous exercise,

23
00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.627
so all of that code is included in this one

24
00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:07.448
but there's nothing really that you

25
00:01:07.448 --> 00:01:09.317
have to worry too much about this,

26
00:01:09.317 --> 00:01:10.885
although we will have added this,

27
00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:12.717
which is the little menu button,

28
00:01:12.717 --> 00:01:14.507
and when you click that on mobile

29
00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.840
it's gonna show up and down.

30
00:01:17.768 --> 00:01:20.157
We've got hero, which is just like a big photo.

31
00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:21.707
So a lot of times websites have these nice

32
00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:24.776
big photos here when you load the page,

33
00:01:24.776 --> 00:01:27.609
maybe it's a banner for something.

34
00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:29.733
We've got a detail section

35
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.136
which may have some information about

36
00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:32.385
your product or your website.

37
00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:33.888
We've got a sign up form,

38
00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:37.496
and then I've got just a footer here.

39
00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:39.016
So all of those sections, great

40
00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:42.397
and this is essentially what it's going to do.

41
00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:46.077
Let me just turn the style on the answer.

42
00:01:46.077 --> 00:01:48.910
Style-answer.css and refresh this.

43
00:01:49.997 --> 00:01:54.568
So when I go down, and I've set this to go down at

44
00:01:54.568 --> 00:01:57.997
500 pixels so you'll notice that this is just normal

45
00:01:57.997 --> 00:01:59.761
this is how we had it before.

46
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:03.222
But if I bring it on down to close to 500,

47
00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:06.982
you'll see what happens is whoa, look what happens here.

48
00:02:06.982 --> 00:02:10.371
So first of all, our menu goes to the top.

49
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.651
Because more likely than not you're gonna want

50
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.182
your menu to be able to open and close,

51
00:02:15.182 --> 00:02:17.278
something like that.

52
00:02:17.278 --> 00:02:19.861
Our header goes below the menu.

53
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:25.550
Then we bring this details and the form box up.

54
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.883
So these two above the hero.

55
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.702
And then we just let the hero and

56
00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:32.651
the footer go at the bottom.

57
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:34.587
So pretty standard little ordering.

58
00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:36.439
It's pretty straight forward.

59
00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.440
I'm just gonna show you how to do it.

60
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.601
And there is one little gotcha with this menu,

61
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:44.422
sure used to using jQuery toggle because

62
00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:46.950
it's specific to flexbox.

63
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.737
So let's go ahead, I'm just gonna change this back

64
00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:53.001
to style.css and we'll head into our style.css.

65
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:54.819
What do we got here?

66
00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.822
Again, this is just really simple HTML.

67
00:02:56.822 --> 00:02:58.142
It's probably, it's not something

68
00:02:58.142 --> 00:03:01.222
you're gonna take and use on a website.

69
00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:04.201
I've just appended a bunch of styles to all of the links,

70
00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:06.010
just for simplicity's sake.

71
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.620
If we scroll down, scroll down,

72
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.037
pretty much everything up until here is just styling.

73
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.190
So all of that so far is just styling,

74
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.030
just make sure that our demo doesn't look totally terrible.

75
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.270
Right here, you'll notice that this is for

76
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.321
the flexible nav that we built in the last exercise.

77
00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:27.241
So we're keeping that.

78
00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:29.001
That's gonna work totally fine.

79
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.430
Then we got our, this is for our flexible nav as well

80
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.510
with a breakpoint.

81
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.662
And then here, the 500px, that's where I want

82
00:03:34.662 --> 00:03:37.829
everything to go on and sorta kick in.

83
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.302
So underneath this, what do we really wanna do?

84
00:03:43.302 --> 00:03:46.771
So because all of these sections here,

85
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:51.211
we've got a header, a nav, a section, a section,

86
00:03:51.211 --> 00:03:53.171
a section, and a footer,

87
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.030
because we wanna append an order property to them,

88
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.159
you tell me what sort of element does

89
00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.622
an order property go on?

90
00:03:59.622 --> 00:04:02.550
It goes on a flex-item, right.

91
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.091
So in order to have flex-items,

92
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:07.102
like we can't just go ahead and select the header

93
00:04:07.102 --> 00:04:10.935
and say display flex-item, that's not a thing.

94
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:15.302
In order to make something flex-items,

95
00:04:15.302 --> 00:04:19.239
we actually need to go ahead and turn the parent

96
00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.851
which in this case is the wrapper,

97
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:23.610
which is why I always recommend

98
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.719
even if you're doing like a full bleed website,

99
00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:29.611
even if these divs here were just going left to right,

100
00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:31.370
you should always wrap your website in

101
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.821
some sort of wrapper div, just in case

102
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:35.870
you run into a situation like this.

103
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.411
So I'm gonna go ahead and say .wrapper

104
00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:43.628
display flex so that will turn our wrapper

105
00:04:43.628 --> 00:04:47.571
into a flex-container and our immediate children

106
00:04:47.571 --> 00:04:48.904
into flex-items.

107
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:53.708
So now I'm gonna refresh, you see nothing changes

108
00:04:53.708 --> 00:04:57.421
cause we gotta hit that 500 pixel breakpoint.

109
00:04:57.421 --> 00:05:00.254
So let's go ahead and hit that and

110
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:04.011
whoa, what's happening here?

111
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:07.344
As soon as we hit that 500px breakpoint,

112
00:05:08.462 --> 00:05:11.342
you'll notice that everything just kinda

113
00:05:11.342 --> 00:05:12.542
gets all jumbled up here

114
00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:15.041
and I think this is one of the frustrations with flexbox.

115
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:17.462
Is that you just turn it on, and it just

116
00:05:17.462 --> 00:05:19.462
breaks your entire website and people go ahh

117
00:05:19.462 --> 00:05:20.721
I can't deal with this.

118
00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:23.040
It's too much work to get it up and running.

119
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.422
However, you'll know that by default

120
00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:28.422
the flex direction is what?

121
00:05:28.422 --> 00:05:29.753
The flex direction is rows right?

122
00:05:29.753 --> 00:05:31.073
We spent all these videos looking at

123
00:05:31.073 --> 00:05:34.131
these columns of content in which that

124
00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:36.041
they were lined out in a row.

125
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:39.201
So we wanna switch the main access in the horizontal.

126
00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:40.993
We wanna swap them and the way that we do that

127
00:05:40.993 --> 00:05:43.660
is we say flex-direction column.

128
00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:49.011
And give that a refresh and okay good.

129
00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:50.862
So now it's a column and all of our things

130
00:05:50.862 --> 00:05:53.680
are laid out in column view.

131
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.702
So good, we're kinda back where we were.

132
00:05:57.702 --> 00:06:01.380
Next up what we wanna do is start applying

133
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.047
ordering to each of these items.

134
00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:07.950
So the first thing I would want to do

135
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.611
is do it on our flex-nav so I go ahead and select that

136
00:06:12.611 --> 00:06:14.961
as a class of flex-nav on there for.

137
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:17.311
If we want that to be first, you might think like

138
00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:20.142
okay we'll do order one and give it a save,

139
00:06:20.142 --> 00:06:22.809
and refresh and when we do that,

140
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:26.713
whoa, where does our nav go?

141
00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:28.780
Our nav goes to the bottom of the page

142
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.113
and how come when you say it is one,

143
00:06:31.113 --> 00:06:33.211
it goes all the way to the end?

144
00:06:33.211 --> 00:06:35.628
So this is because by default

145
00:06:37.051 --> 00:06:39.342
the order of all elements is what?

146
00:06:39.342 --> 00:06:41.341
It's zero, it's a big fat zero.

147
00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:43.902
So what we need to do is put a

148
00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:46.342
default order on everything else,

149
00:06:46.342 --> 00:06:49.401
and this is kinda like z and x,

150
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:54.313
so what I have been doing is I select every flex-item.

151
00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:55.881
So that's just a quick little selector

152
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.881
of every immediate child of wrapper.

153
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.051
Just put a little comma here say flex-item,

154
00:07:02.051 --> 00:07:06.301
and maybe we'll tell ourselves here flex-container.

155
00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:13.673
Okay and what we'll do with that is we'll

156
00:07:13.673 --> 00:07:16.561
put an order and if I want to be able to say

157
00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.040
like one two three four five

158
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.401
without having to worry about everything

159
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:23.761
being order one, you can do order, and just put like

160
00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:26.569
put a high number on there like 9999.

161
00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:28.402
And give it a refresh.

162
00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:31.193
And now you'll notice that,

163
00:07:31.193 --> 00:07:32.851
so everything is set to a really low number

164
00:07:32.851 --> 00:07:34.121
and because they're all the same,

165
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:35.321
they're still gonna

166
00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:37.553
when the flex order is exactly the same for

167
00:07:37.553 --> 00:07:40.081
all of them, like if two flex-items have the same order,

168
00:07:40.081 --> 00:07:42.281
what will happen is the order that they

169
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:45.964
show up in the DOM or in the HTML will take precedence.

170
00:07:45.964 --> 00:07:49.131
So now our order one is working great.

171
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.281
But again, when you get to mobile,

172
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:54.833
you don't want your nav to be open by default,

173
00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:56.472
so we'll take a quick look here.

174
00:07:56.472 --> 00:08:00.330
I've got this link with a class of toggle nav.

175
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.091
And then we've got this UL that holds all of our links.

176
00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:07.674
So we want to go ahead and say .togglenav display block

177
00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:11.982
and that should, there we go.

178
00:08:11.982 --> 00:08:15.100
It makes this nice little toggle nav one for us,

179
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.161
and we wanna hide the other one so that's flex-nav ul

180
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:20.244
display none.

181
00:08:23.471 --> 00:08:24.953
Great so while we're there,

182
00:08:24.953 --> 00:08:28.433
if I go ahead and click this you'll notice that

183
00:08:28.433 --> 00:08:32.393
it's not working and the reason behind that is

184
00:08:32.393 --> 00:08:35.060
if we open up our dev tools here

185
00:08:36.422 --> 00:08:39.302
and go to elements, and just open this up so that

186
00:08:39.302 --> 00:08:42.342
we can see this navigation here and go ahead and click it

187
00:08:42.342 --> 00:08:44.691
and you'll notice that there's a class of open,

188
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.513
being toggle on and off on and off.

189
00:08:47.513 --> 00:08:48.900
Now why did I do that?

190
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.941
If we look at the jQuery just at the bottom here,

191
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:54.382
I say when the link with the class of toggle nav

192
00:08:54.382 --> 00:08:58.342
is clicked then grab the flex-nav unordered list

193
00:08:58.342 --> 00:09:00.171
and toggle the class of open.

194
00:09:00.171 --> 00:09:02.593
So you may be saying like why don't you just do

195
00:09:02.593 --> 00:09:05.160
something like slide toggle,

196
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.551
which is kinda cool cause you get

197
00:09:06.551 --> 00:09:08.712
the animation along with it.

198
00:09:08.712 --> 00:09:10.841
So give that a save and refresh,

199
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:14.361
and cool it works, but the main--

200
00:09:14.361 --> 00:09:17.881
The thing here is like, remember our

201
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:21.990
these guys right here were stacked four in a row

202
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.742
and now that they are just one two three four

203
00:09:25.742 --> 00:09:26.941
stacked like that,

204
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.981
and the reason behind that is because

205
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:32.190
for these ones to stack side by side

206
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.690
and especially like if we're talking about

207
00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:39.488
this one right here as well,

208
00:09:39.488 --> 00:09:41.350
where they stack one two one two one two

209
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.289
and then four beside each other,

210
00:09:43.289 --> 00:09:47.116
for that to actually work on our mobile

211
00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:49.068
when we open it on up,

212
00:09:49.068 --> 00:09:52.769
we actually need this ul to be display flex

213
00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:55.709
not display block and when you use jQuery toggle

214
00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:57.997
or slide toggle or something like that,

215
00:09:57.997 --> 00:10:00.689
it just changes it from display none to display flex.

216
00:10:00.689 --> 00:10:03.238
So unfortunately we can't use slide toggle,

217
00:10:03.238 --> 00:10:06.918
we need to toggle our own class of open

218
00:10:06.918 --> 00:10:08.588
and go back here,

219
00:10:08.588 --> 00:10:10.809
and when it has a class of open,

220
00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:12.110
gonna go down into here,

221
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.360
we'll say .flex-nav ul.open

222
00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:18.070
normally you'd say display block

223
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.750
but in our case we're saying display flex.

224
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.598
Give that a save.

225
00:10:22.598 --> 00:10:26.089
And it works great so it just pops open and closed

226
00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:27.649
so there's no animation there,

227
00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:29.529
if you wanted to you could pop some

228
00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:33.078
css height animations on there which would

229
00:10:33.078 --> 00:10:35.299
allow us to slide it open and closed

230
00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:36.899
open and closed and then I think that's sort of

231
00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:38.350
the better way to do it as well.

232
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.750
We're slowly moving away, moving our

233
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.779
animations outta things like jQuery and back into css.

234
00:10:43.779 --> 00:10:45.569
So that's it for our nav.

235
00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:48.379
We've got that all up and running.

236
00:10:48.379 --> 00:10:50.607
Up next we need to re-order some of our items.

237
00:10:50.607 --> 00:10:52.150
So we thought about this,

238
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.150
this is one, we have this one as two

239
00:10:56.498 --> 00:10:58.230
so let's go ahead and do that

240
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.989
so it's just .top. Why?

241
00:10:59.989 --> 00:11:03.190
Because if you look at it, we've got a header

242
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.447
with a class of top so just top is enough for a selector.

243
00:11:06.447 --> 00:11:10.278
And we'll say not flex, order two, give it a save.

244
00:11:10.278 --> 00:11:11.979
And that's not gonna do anything but

245
00:11:11.979 --> 00:11:15.299
just because we're gonna be changing the ones after it

246
00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:17.289
we have to explicitly set it to two.

247
00:11:17.289 --> 00:11:20.926
Next up we want this, details here,

248
00:11:20.926 --> 00:11:23.337
so this is a section with a class of details

249
00:11:23.337 --> 00:11:25.409
and section with a class of sign up.

250
00:11:25.409 --> 00:11:27.886
We want those to be three and four.

251
00:11:27.886 --> 00:11:31.803
So I can go ahead and say .details order three,

252
00:11:33.956 --> 00:11:38.123
and I'll just go ahead and say .signup order four.

253
00:11:40.396 --> 00:11:43.078
Now give that a save and a refresh.

254
00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:46.118
And perfect, looks like we've got everything in order.

255
00:11:46.118 --> 00:11:47.099
Our nav is still working.

256
00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:48.809
We've got our header, we've got our details,

257
00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:50.278
we've got our content, and then we don't

258
00:11:50.278 --> 00:11:52.689
have to worry about setting these to be five and six.

259
00:11:52.689 --> 00:11:53.670
How come?

260
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.757
Because since they already set to 9999,

261
00:11:56.757 --> 00:11:59.710
they are just going to be appended at the bottom

262
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.889
in the order that they show up.

263
00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:05.830
So since hero comes first, and footer comes next,

264
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.510
they are going to show up.

265
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.486
That's actually kind of a neat thing to show as well,

266
00:12:09.486 --> 00:12:12.673
like this is the order, just put your cursor

267
00:12:12.673 --> 00:12:14.863
over top of your elements and watch it jump around

268
00:12:14.863 --> 00:12:16.894
from top to bottom.

269
00:12:16.894 --> 00:12:18.452
So that's mobile re-ordering.

270
00:12:18.452 --> 00:12:20.263
Pretty handy, pretty simple, I think.

271
00:12:20.263 --> 00:12:22.124
Just make sure that you have your wrapper

272
00:12:22.124 --> 00:12:23.861
as a display flex and then you can

273
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:27.055
go ahead and use the flex ordering property

274
00:12:27.055 --> 00:12:29.423
in order to move them around.

275
00:12:29.423 --> 00:12:31.021
See you in the next video.

276
00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:33.604
(bright music)
