(playful whistling music)

2
00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.579
<v Wes>Next up, we want to talk about sort of the final</v>

3
00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.059
one in our little mini, four-video series of alignment

4
00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.462
here, and it's called align-self.

5
00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:24.129
Now, we've been looking at one two or three years ago

6
00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:26.669
called align-items, and by default you'll remember that

7
00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.086
the default is stretch - if you can spell stretch.

8
00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:33.945
And in a refresh, you'll see the stretching from

9
00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:34.921
top to bottom.

10
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:39.482
We had other ones like flex-start, and that will start

11
00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:40.579
them at the top.

12
00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.073
We have flex-end, and that will start them at the end.

13
00:00:44.073 --> 00:00:46.642
You get the point here.

14
00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:48.343
What I want to do real quick, just so we can see, is

15
00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:50.763
I'm going to leave it at flex-start, and I'm just going

16
00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:55.096
to give it like box 2, a height - or, maybe not a

17
00:00:56.267 --> 00:00:58.795
height - we'll say padding-bottom - 200.

18
00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:01.212
A box 6, padding bottom zero.

19
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.930
A box 9, padding bottom 50.

20
00:01:08.622 --> 00:01:10.663
So I just want to like give each one a little bit different

21
00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:14.606
so that we can see this is how they anchor themselves.

22
00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:18.592 line:15% 
Again, if we switch it to flex-end, they're going to

23
00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:21.814 line:15% 
anchor themselves from the bottom and grow up there.

24
00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.281
So, that's great, but like, what if you wanted just one

25
00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:28.597
of these to have some sort of other attribute there?

26
00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:30.647
And that's where align-self comes in.

27
00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:34.863
So, if I take this box 9, say align-self, we can say

28
00:01:34.863 --> 00:01:35.696
flex-end.

29
00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:41.834
Now, flex-end was going to just overwrite the flex-start.

30
00:01:42.244 --> 00:01:44.424
So by default, we just apply it right on the container,

31
00:01:44.424 --> 00:01:47.612
but we can apply it on an individual item, and we can

32
00:01:47.612 --> 00:01:49.984
say things like flex-end, and that will just overwrite

33
00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:51.901
that specific use case.

34
00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:55.179
Now, we can use any of our align items on it, so I can say

35
00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.324
something like center, it'll pop it right in the center.

36
00:01:57.324 --> 00:02:01.846
We also have baseline, which is going to use the font

37
00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:04.129
so by default, you're not going to see anything there.

38
00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:07.796
And we have the stretch, if you want to bring it back

39
00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:10.376
to that, and that will just stretch just that one on

40
00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:12.003
a cross.

41
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.198
So, that is align-self.

42
00:02:14.198 --> 00:02:16.401
It's kind of handy, it's exactly like align-items except

43
00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:18.117
you can apply it on a case-per-case basis on an

44
00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:20.765
individual flex item, rather than the entire

45
00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.015
flex container.

46
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:26.127
In the next video, we're going to be looking at how

47
00:02:26.127 --> 00:02:30.377
we can use flex units to be able to size our items.

48
00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:34.094
(upbeat whistling tune outro)
