<v ->(upbeat music)</v>

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.680
<v Narrator>Alright, let's talk about images in Gatsby.</v>

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.513
<v ->This is some of the special sauce that Gatsby has</v>

4
00:00:07.513 --> 00:00:12.492
because images make your website very slow.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.930
And the steps that you need to take in order to make your

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.770
website fast with images are often too hard

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.100
for just a regular web developer.

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.257
So what Gatsby does is it makes the progressive loading

9
00:00:26.257 --> 00:00:28.810
and the different resizing and compression

10
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.770
of your images much faster.

11
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.618
So let's talk real quickly about like

12
00:00:33.618 --> 00:00:37.680
what, is wrong with images on the internet?

13
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.410
Sometimes they are too big, meaning like, I've got

14
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.650
this one right here and maybe it's,

15
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.240
it came off of my digital SLR and it's eight megs

16
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.500
and have to resize the whole thing.

17
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.523
Sometimes they are not compressed.

18
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.760
So the file size, maybe it's the right size,

19
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.190
but it could be 50% smaller because you can compress it with

20
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.180
an algorithm and you can't even see the human eye,

21
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.130
that's called lost lists and lossy compression

22
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.030
so lossless is it makes it as small as possible without

23
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.610
giving up any quality and lossy compression is

24
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.320
it makes it as small as possible,

25
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.350
but also does give up some of the quality.

26
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.760
What else it could be not the same width and height.

27
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.990
So that could be a problem where you're like,

28
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.550
you want to resize this thing to be a perfect square,

29
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.170
but you don't really necessarily have the right tools

30
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.780
to do that or you don't want to open them all up

31
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.500
in Photoshop or something like that.

32
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.660
There could be like a poor loading performance,

33
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.550
so you could load this thing in, but as it's downloading,

34
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.500
I'm personally on a really slow internet connection

35
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380
right now, you just see nothing.

36
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.410
It's just a white box, right?

37
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.220
And then like not the right format.

38
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.940
So there are lots of different formats for images

39
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.580
you can PNGs and JPEGs,

40
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.570
we have web P, which is in a lot of browsers,

41
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.560
but not all of them.

42
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.730
So do you have to make like a JPEG and a web P version

43
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.360
of that image and I'm tired, even just talking about this,

44
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.270
images are too hard on the internet.

45
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.660
So, Gatsby will do is you can just tell Gatsby

46
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.890
the width and the height or the size or the format

47
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.750
or any of these pieces of information,

48
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.120
and it's going to deliver to you this,

49
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.630
let me just inspect one of these suckers here.

50
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.630
It's going to deliver to you what is called a Gatsby image

51
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.182
and it has all of that stuff in there for you,

52
00:02:35.182 --> 00:02:37.100
and you know you the, you don't have to worry

53
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.933
about it, right?

54
00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:41.050
So this is my picture of a pizza,

55
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.300
and inside of there, we've got, first of all,

56
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.420
it takes care of ratios, so, you know,

57
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.370
ratios are kind of hard in CSS.

58
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.350
Then it gives us this data image,

59
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.590
so this is what it's going to show while it's loading.

60
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.430
It's a 20 PX by 50 I showed you this already,

61
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.590
but let me show you one more time.

62
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.190
Look at the tiny little pizza, so that's not even an image

63
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.463
and then when I load the page,

64
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.580
you see how they're blurry for a quick second

65
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.350
and then they load in the pixelated part is,

66
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.880
I added that in CSS I'll show you that in a bit,

67
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.090
but it's showing the blurry version of the image

68
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.380
while it downloads the actual full version of the image.

69
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.210
So that's what this sucker is right here.

70
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.570
Then we have a picture element that's part of HTML,

71
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.960
and it tries first to serve you

72
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.940
up a, web P version.

73
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.230
Otherwise it will try to serve you up a JPEG,

74
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.230
and then it also will serve multiple versions of that image,

75
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.590
depending on like, this is a little media query right here,

76
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.260
depending on the size of, of the actual image.

77
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.040
So all kinds of heavy lifting,

78
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.840
it does for you under the hood,

79
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.520
and it nicely feeds them in

80
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.320
when they're finished loading in.

81
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.560
So that's why Gatsby image is really, cool.

82
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.240
Now, in order to use Gatsby image you need something

83
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.500
to actually process all of those images cause

84
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.500
you, the developer, you can throw in a JPEG

85
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.870
hot off your camera into this thing,

86
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.850
but you shouldn't load that on the website because of all

87
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.420
the reasons we just talked about.

88
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.020
So you need a either a service or a computer

89
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.920
that will manually process all of those versions

90
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.760
of the images, they're gonna make a base 64 version.

91
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.020
They're going to make a JPEG version,

92
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.390
and they'll make a couple versions of the JPEGs

93
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.110
that are small and large, and they'll make a web P version

94
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.590
and so even if you have one file,

95
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.070
you might end up with seven or eight different actual files

96
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.950
behind the scenes, and the browser will take care

97
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.410
of showing which one it wants.

98
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.910
Now, in order to process them,

99
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.420
there's sort of two ways you can do it.

100
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.740
The first one is you can source your images.

101
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.430
If you have your images in a directory

102
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.580
in your website, you can source them much like

103
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.650
we source our data from sanity,

104
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.430
and then you can pipe them

105
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.090
through Gats B sharp.

106
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.490
Gatsby plugin, sharpen and sharp is something

107
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.900
that will run on your computer,

108
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.500
or it's something that will run on like

109
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.420
your netlify, your build process, and it will resize

110
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.070
and generate all those images for you.

111
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.810
Now that can take a long time, I personally have,

112
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.170
I don't know, three or 400 images

113
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.750
on my personal Westboss.com

114
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.180
And a fresh build takes, around 20 minutes

115
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.370
or so in order to, to get that all of those images done.

116
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.110
Cause image processing is very expensive,

117
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.370
meaning it takes a lot of computer power.

118
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.090
Now there are ways around that

119
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.853
and the sort of the alternative to that is you can still use

120
00:05:46.853 --> 00:05:50.000
cut the image, but you can use it with a service.

121
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.980
So there's lots of services out there where you can either

122
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.690
upload your image directly to them,

123
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.670
or you feed them your image,

124
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.020
and then it will then produce all of those for you on demand

125
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.440
as the, as the customer or as the user actually requests it.

126
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.500
So what are those services?

127
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.620
So sanity has a thing called the image pipeline,

128
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.360
that is what we will be using.

129
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.820
So sanity comes in with already with their image pipeline

130
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.970
and it's compatible with Gatsby image.

131
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.180
There's also Cloudinary, which is a really good one.

132
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.707
They have a pretty generous free tier.

133
00:06:25.707 --> 00:06:28.350
ImageX is another good one.

134
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.550
I'm sure there's lots of different ones out there.

135
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.090
So this is sort of where you want to make your decision,

136
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.610
whether you want to do it all yourself and use

137
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.690
the compute power or use a service, which doesn't on demand

138
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.350
for you and sort of speeds up your build.

139
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.160
Lucky for us, it's all built into sanity

140
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.800
so we will be going the sanity route,

141
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.040
but just know that Gatsby image works the same way

142
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.360
with regardless of your service.

143
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.760
So let's go ahead and open up our pizzalist.js

144
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.140
and let's open up our website here and go to our

145
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.580
pizza menu and let's inspect that component.

146
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.350
What was it called a single pizza?

147
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.810
Here we go, open up our pizza,

148
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.240
let's see our image, asset fluid,

149
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.433
look at all the good stuff that's in here.

150
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.030
So they give you an aspect ratio.

151
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.690
They give you the base 64 version of that image

152
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.760
so if I were to copy that,

153
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.350
I'd take these quotes off, that didn't Oh,

154
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.790
they truncated it on the end.

155
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.950
They'd give you the different sizes that are here,

156
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.840
source or set, source that web P all the information

157
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.260
that we need in order for it to work.

158
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.070
Now, we don't have to take all these things

159
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.100
and put them together, We can use a custom image element

160
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.110
that ships with Gatsby and, and feed it this entire thing.

161
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.260
Now, there are two different types of images

162
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.800
that you can feed to Gatsby image.

163
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.130
There's fixed, and that's when you have

164
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.690
a fixed within a height.

165
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.760
And then there is fluid, and though that's mostly like,

166
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.820
you'll want, what you'll want, because it's responsive.

167
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.401
Meaning you can resize the image.

168
00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:11.010
See how I'm resizing the sucker

169
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.120
and look at, let's see how the image,

170
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.773
you can see the whole pie there,

171
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.293
and here it's sort of crop.

172
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.390
And that allows me to have the same height of the other

173
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.940
pizza that it's in it's row, but as I resize

174
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.600
you can see that they resize themselves

175
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.060
and do everything for you.

176
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.330
So most situations I'm going to say you want fluid.

177
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.950
Another kind of cool thing is look,

178
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.640
these are not loaded yet.

179
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.930
Gatsby will only load those on demand

180
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.280
as you scroll them in to view.

181
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.840
And that's pretty cool because you're not using

182
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.050
unnecessary bandwidth, both on your server,

183
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.500
as well as the customer who's visiting your website.

184
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.800
All of that stuff adds up to really slick and fast website.

185
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.810
And like, quite honestly,

186
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.400
I was never gonna do all that work myself.

187
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.290
But if it's built into a plugin all day long, let's do it.

188
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.733
So let's go into our single pizza here.

189
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:09.290
We're going to import, IMG from Gatsby-image.

190
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.310
So the package is called Gatsby-image.

191
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.330
This is put out by Gatsy themselves.

192
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.400
You might be asking like, Wes, why didn't you just go ahead

193
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.430
and use your fancy image import trick.

194
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.350
And if you look here, it doesn't show up.

195
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.730
And that's because I think the actual export is named

196
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.280
Gatsby image, but I like to name it,

197
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.900
IMG and that's how you're going to see it used

198
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.770
primarily throughout the web.

199
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.160
And let's go down below this paragraph tag here

200
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.800
and we'll use our IMG tag so it's capital IMG.

201
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.220
That's how you know that it's a custom component

202
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.370
and not a HTML image tag.

203
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.370
And you are to want to say source, but it's not source

204
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:57.010
it's fluid is equal to curly brackets.

205
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.260
And then we give it access to that data so

206
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.260
pizza.image.asset.fluid.

207
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.910
I'll go to our website that we're working here,

208
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.060
look at this boom, boom gets loaded right in.

209
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.070
All of that hard work, just tucked away

210
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.040
in one really nice thing.

211
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.030
We can also go ahead and or we should, for sure we pass it,

212
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.160
the additional things that you're used to with an image

213
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.740
and in this case, we always want to pass an alt.

214
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.810
So that image is accessible indeed let's just take

215
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.010
the pizza, that name and pass it in there.

216
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.130
You might say you might be tempted to say like a picture

217
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.140
of the pizza.name

218
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.690
But it's assumed that it's a picture

219
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.450
when somebody uses a screen reader,

220
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.400
it will announce to them that it is a picture or an image

221
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.740
or something like that so you don't need to.

222
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.260
So we just pass the pizza.name as the attribute.

223
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.870
Good so that is the basics of Gatsby image,

224
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.780
but if you wanted a different size of that image,

225
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.720
we could go to where we query that data.

226
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.720
So let's go to a, was it pizzas.js? That's our page.

227
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.190
And you see here, we're recruiting the image,

228
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:14.120
we asked for the fluid where it's a max width of 400.

229
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.180
We could of course change that value,

230
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.980
or we could also get a fixed value.

231
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.853
You could hear, we could say fixed.

232
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.540
Yeah, we want a fixed value of what is it

233
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.540
width 200, height 200,

234
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.950
and then ... it'd be Gatsby sanity image,

235
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:41.060
fixed, not fluid, give that a save.

236
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.923
Now, if we go and look at the data that we have here,

237
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.223
we'll go to our components, Pizza, image.

238
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.400
<v ->It's not opening I got to refresh,</v>

239
00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.180
I go pizza, image, asset fixed.

240
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.480
There we go, now it will give us the actual fixed

241
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.200
pieces of information that we could then pass to here.

242
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.753
Serum would go say, fixed and fixed, give it a save.

243
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.600
You see, now that that image is a fixed size

244
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.760
and it's not responsive.

245
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.610
Like you would expect with the, the fluid version.

246
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.680
So let's dial that back, I'm going to leave the query

247
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.400
in for the fixed and the fluid,

248
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.810
just so that you can come back to this at any given time.

249
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.610
Or, it should also show you, let me show you real quick.

250
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.790
You can do something silly,

251
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.780
like a width of 600 and a height of 200,

252
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.390
and let's bring that back to fixed and you'll see

253
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.980
that it will chop the image for you, and then in the future,

254
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.300
when we do this with people,

255
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.190
I'm going to show you how to like,

256
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.350
make sure that the person's face is right in the center.

257
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.090
So we're not accidentally cutting them off

258
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.920
so bring that back to fluid.

259
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.170
They also have really good errors.

260
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.650
If you accidentally mix up fixed and fluid,

261
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.080
that's it for the Gatsby images.

262
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.480
Let's get into the next one.
