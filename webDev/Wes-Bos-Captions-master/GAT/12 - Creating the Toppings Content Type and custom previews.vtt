00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.583
(bell chiming)

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.600
<v Instructor>Hi let's keep going with our schema.</v>

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.360
I pulled up the docs here just to show you,

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.920
how do I know all these options

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.630
while you look it up in the doc?

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.800
So I went to the sanity.io4/docs

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.800
and then I went down to reference and schema types.

8
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.850
And in here you'll see all of the different types

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.683
that we have.

10
00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:29.460
Obviously so far we've used text, we've used slug,

11
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.230
and you can see there's a whole bunch of different options

12
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.960
here including like stuff for geolocation

13
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.250
and Google Maps inputs, file uploads linking

14
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.880
to other documents, Array of Things.

15
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.420
So if you wanted to have like multiple text inputs

16
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.330
or multiple image uploads you could do an array of,

17
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.090
and we'll be looking at examples of that.

18
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.810
But right now let's work on the topping

19
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.890
because we've got our pizza

20
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.600
and then we're gonna have a second data type

21
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.840
that's called topping

22
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.110
and then our pizza will have many toppings.

23
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.160
That's a pretty common thing you wanna do

24
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.210
and a thing that's called a one to many relationship

25
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.640
where one pizza has many toppings

26
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.210
and then the topping, you could go the other way

27
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.150
and we are gonna do that.

28
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.070
You're gonna say based on this topping

29
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.480
show me pizzas that have that topping on it.

30
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.440
So we'll go to our schema and say topping.js

31
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.820
and what I'll do here is I just copy everything

32
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.400
from pizza.js and paste it in there, sort of a base.

33
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.980
And then I go and delete or maybe just start

34
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.070
to switch things out.

35
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.930
Maybe I'll delete all the fields except for the first one

36
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.483
'cause it's likely we want a name as well.

37
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.090
Okay then we will import the icon.

38
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.723
We'll say FaPepperHot.

39
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.040
And that comes from FA so this is coming from Font Awesome.

40
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.510
And this is why I really liked this react-icons package

41
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.070
because you can pull one icon from one library,

42
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.840
another icon from another library

43
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.940
and what it does is it actually just imports that icon

44
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.560
and not the entire library for you.

45
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.550
Then we'll go down here and we'll say the name is topping,

46
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.120
always do singular lowercase for the name.

47
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.670
And then the title you can, whatever is a human readable.

48
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.680
I'm gonna call it toppings.

49
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.960
The type is a document.

50
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.760
The icon is the icon that we imported right here.

51
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.650
And then the different fields that we have are,

52
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.280
first we have the name of the topping.

53
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.720
What is the name of the topping?

54
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.770
And then let's just stop there and make sure

55
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.980
that it's actually showing up.

56
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.800
So if you go to your dashboard you'll see it's not there

57
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.950
like it's not showing up yet.

58
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.460
And that's because we've not yet merged

59
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.440
that into our schema.

60
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.090
We've created the file but we have not yet done it here.

61
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.340
So we can just duplicate this import pizza from pizza,

62
00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.350
duplicate it.

63
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.060
I'm just rename that to topping.

64
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.330
That's a little trick I like to use is doubleClick

65
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.440
the first one.

66
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.800
I hit command D to select the next instance of it

67
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.520
and then just type topping and go here

68
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.173
to where we have it comma topping.

69
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.560
And now I give it a second to refresh something broke.

70
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.270
Okay, let's see here.

71
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.820
Module build failed.

72
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.660
It's telling us that this, right,

73
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.170
let's take a look at. okay look.

74
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.280
So we could have told that if I saw the little squiggle,

75
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.280
unexpected token fields I forgot the closing curly bracket

76
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.793
for that field, there we go.

77
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.120
Here we go, so your toppings shows up and it should allow us

78
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.963
to create a new topping with a name input.

79
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.030
Beautiful, by the way if this seems slow,

80
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.540
it's because I'm on extremely slow internet connection

81
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.400
right now.

82
00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.920
I'm about my cottage in the woods.

83
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.180
So it's normally much faster than that.

84
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.780
That's not effective.

85
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.080
The CMS it's effective me being in the middle

86
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.670
of the woods.

87
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.810
Let's go back to the toppings

88
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.173
and get the rest of the fields here.

89
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.350
So I'm going to have another one called a vegetarian.

90
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.610
And that will allow us to mark

91
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.153
Whether that topping is vegetarian or not.

92
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.310
And the type will be, well let's look at the docs here,

93
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.610
a Boolean click onto it.

94
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.530
The type is required options layout,

95
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.450
either a switch or a checkbox.

96
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.990
This lets you control the visual appearance of the input.

97
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.840
By default the input for Boolean fields

98
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.470
will be displayed as a switch

99
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.450
but you can also make it appear as a check box.

100
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.220
Okay, let's try that.

101
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.220
We'll change it to Boolean, balling Boolean.

102
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.610
There we go, and then I think what was the setting?

103
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.610
Layout, it can be a checkbox let's see what that looks like.

104
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.663
It's still a switch.

105
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.380
Layout option can be a switch, default or checkbox.

106
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.430
It doesn't seem like it's working.

107
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.640
Maybe that's a little bug in the library

108
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.250
but that's typically how you would apply.

109
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.820
Oh no, no, no I'm wrong.

110
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.040
It's options.

111
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.070
So options go on like that. right?

112
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.640
And then the layout goes in there.

113
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.210
That's not at the library it's a bug on my brain.

114
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.803
Here we go, it's cool I like it.

115
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.253
We will what do we do?

116
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.560
Yeah I like to check box better.

117
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.410
Let's do the checkbox okay, cool.

118
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.040
Let's go ahead and add a couple toppings.

119
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.980
And I'm gonna show you how to create

120
00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:14.140
a custom prepared view here.

121
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.000
So let's say Pepperoni

122
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.213
and that is not vegetarian.

123
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.723
And let's make it a new, another one onions.

124
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.010
And that is vegetarian.

125
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.490
And another one mushrooms, that is vegetarian.

126
00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:42.929
And then let's do bacon.

127
00:06:48.285 --> 00:06:51.166
And that is not vegetarian.

128
00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:54.870
Okay so, well, we see this layout right here,

129
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.700
but default is just gonna give you the name of the topping.

130
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.700
However, you can control what shows up in here rather

131
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.290
by default, it will just grab the name of the thing.

132
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.110
But if you wanna control what shows up under the toppings

133
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.630
you totally can.

134
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.380
And that's done with the preview part of the dock.

135
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.380
So if we take a look here, preview, let's go to reference.

136
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.170
Maybe it would just do this preview.

137
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.230
Oh, there we go, Sanity Studio.

138
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.870
So if you're looking at all this stuff,

139
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.880
you always wanna look for the Sanity Studio.

140
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.530
One is, that's what we're working in.

141
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.760
And you see the first thing we need to do here is select.

142
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.170
So it say, okay, well you're gonna generate

143
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.600
this preview right here.

144
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.010
What fields do we need to generate the preview?

145
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.400
So we'll go here and say preview

146
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.153
that's not under fields that is here preview.

147
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.380
We wanna select the following fields for it to work.

148
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.513
The name is going to be the name field and vegetarian.

149
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.330
Is going to be the vegetarian field.

150
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.370
So basically we're saying select something,

151
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.740
call it name and reference the name field,

152
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.893
select vegetarian, and reference to vegetarian field.

153
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.700
Then if we go back here, you'll see, that does nothing.

154
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.470
Actually it does do something because we've now said,

155
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.290
don't just grab the name field.

156
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.090
We are going to customize what the preview looks like

157
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.450
and now returning nothing.

158
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.510
So we have to have a prepare function

159
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.130
and that will give us all of the fields that we want.

160
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.640
So fields and we'll just do a little arrow function.

161
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.900
And from that you need to return a title.

162
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.460
This is the title.

163
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.310
You see, it's showing whatever is returned

164
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.460
from this prepare function as an object.

165
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.180
The title is going to be whatever is in here.

166
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.440
And then further more we also have media,

167
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.550
which I'll show you how to do that on the pizza,

168
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.890
because you can have images.

169
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.950
If you have images associated with the content type,

170
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.750
you can show it as a preview there.

171
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.750
So like we can then do, let's make this back ticks

172
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.283
and you can interpolate fields. and then name.

173
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.250
Because of the fields, that's the things you selected

174
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.363
and then the name, say bacon, mushroom, onions, pepperoni.

175
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.613
Now what's kind of cool about that is we can say,

176
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.090
let's just make it fields name

177
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.730
and then we will conditionally show a little leaf

178
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.380
if that topping is vegetarian.

179
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.510
So it will say actually.

180
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.260
Let's do it at the end here.

181
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.080
Say if it is vegetarian question mark

182
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.080
then show the leaf emoji.

183
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.423
Maybe it's seedling.

184
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.250
Yeah, it's called seedling.

185
00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.130
Otherwise we will show nothing beside it.

186
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.710
So that's just a nice way to, Oh, that's giving me red.

187
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.690
Why is it vegetarian?

188
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.140
Because it is fields.vegetarian.

189
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.574
There you go, so that's just like a little bit further away

190
00:10:14.574 --> 00:10:18.010
to show what should then show up.

191
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.680
Finally, a lot of people instead of saying fields.name,

192
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.410
fields.vegetarian, what they like to do is to pass

193
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.300
the fields but then destructure the properties

194
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.610
into their own variables.

195
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:35.610
So instead of fields, we just say name and vegetarian

196
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:40.190
and then we can take the fields. off of each of those

197
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.320
and simply just use it.

198
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.240
So this is destructuring in JavaScript

199
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.040
where we take the one argument

200
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.340
which is fields and break it down into their properties

201
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.373
into their own variables, called name and vegetarian.

202
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.640
That looks good, in the next video

203
00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.823
what we'll do now is to relate these two content types

204
00:11:00.823 --> 00:11:04.553
then allow us to pick what toppings are on a specific pizza.
