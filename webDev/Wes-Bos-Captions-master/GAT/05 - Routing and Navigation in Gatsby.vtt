00:00:01.346 --> 00:00:04.670
(Upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.410
<v ->All right, let's talk about navigating from page to page.</v>

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.100
There's a couple of different ways that we can do it.

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.040
So first we probably don't want to write links

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.060
on every single page.

6
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.950
So if we want to make a reusable navigation,

7
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.090
that's where we create a component.

8
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.170
So a page is going to be every single page that we have,

9
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.840
and a component can be reusable pieces

10
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.250
that are used inside of those pages.

11
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.940
So let's go inside of our components folder,

12
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.040
and we're going to create a new file.

13
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.930
That's called, Nav.js

14
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.020
And then in here,

15
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.030
it's the same rules as creating a react component

16
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.100
in regular reacts.

17
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.660
So first we're going to import React from 'react'.

18
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.060
Then we are going to make our component.

19
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.160
So I'm going to have a function.

20
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.203
Will you will call that our Nav,

21
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.393
and then I always like to export default that function.

22
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.470
Sometimes you'll see people do a const Nav= ()=&gt; something

23
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.340
and that is the exact same thing as this.

24
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.650
I just prefer to have a regular function and there's really

25
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.220
no other, there's nothing else to that.

26
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.340
There's no up or down to that, so you choose whatever is,

27
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.727
good for you.

28
00:01:20.727 --> 00:01:23.253
So from that, we are going to return,

29
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.180
well let's return a nav element,

30
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.120
and then inside of that we'll have an unordered list,

31
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.953
and inside of that

32
00:01:30.953 --> 00:01:34.700
we'll have a list item that let's just do a graph.

33
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.470
I'll show you why we're not going to use

34
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.580
a RAF in just a second,

35
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.260
but let's say homepage is going to link to forward slash

36
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.230
and then we'll duplicate that over and we'll do beers.

37
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.263
Let's say beers.

38
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.900 line:15% 
Now, if we go into each of our pages that need the nav,

39
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.940
we'll go into our Slicemasters here and we'll import Nav

40
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.540
from we'll go up a level into components

41
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.560
and then grab our Nav.

42
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.530
Then if we go into here,

43
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.880
we simply can just use our Nav component

44
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.490
and you'll see that it shows up on SlicemastersPage

45
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.790
and if I click it,

46
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.730
I'm actually able to go to the Homepage.

47
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.580
So let's go to our index page, do the exact same thing.

48
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.750
I'm just going to copy that import statement

49
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.750
from Slicemasters and then put our Nav in there as well.

50
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.130
You can see it shows up in there, so, finally,

51
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.360
let's do it on the Beers page so we can see that as well,

52
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.172
paste that in then

53
00:02:33.172 --> 00:02:34.005
(indistinct)

54
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:37.310
for ourselves in Nav, here we go.

55
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.740
So go from home, beers,

56
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.750
home, beers

57
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.760
we're going back and forth,

58
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.100
but you see how we're getting this like

59
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.910
a whole page reload here.

60
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.590
And like you see that the content disappear for a quick

61
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.010
second and then it shows up.

62
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.850
And this is just what the very simple website.

63
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.260
It would be much longer if we had a bigger website.

64
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.040
So instead of using regular anchor links inside of Gatsby,

65
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.740
we use the link tag and the link tag we'll,

66
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.870
just render out an anchor link,

67
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.940
but it will be supercharged,

68
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.220
or it will be sort of loaded with a Java script

69
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.190
that is needed to do push date.

70
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.080
So let me show you the difference here.

71
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.690
Let's go up here and we'll import curly brackets,

72
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.453
capital L link from Gatsby.

73
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.840
And this is what is referred to as a named import

74
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.673
from Gatsby.

75
00:03:29.673 --> 00:03:32.880
So Gatsby, the package will export a whole bunch of stuff.

76
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.530
One of the things is a link component.

77
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.300
Then if we go to our anchor link,

78
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.900
let's just do it for the Homepage right now.

79
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.750
And if we replaced that anchor link with an actual link tag

80
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.290
and then change the ref to

81
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.990
I realized that I'm probably the only person that says ref,

82
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.180
but change it to a href, H R E F.

83
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.580
And so link to forward slash, now watch this.

84
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.940
So we'll go to our beers page that does the full page reload

85
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.810
But now when I click on home, boom!

86
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.610
see how fast it is go to beer home boom!

87
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.443
nice and fast.

88
00:04:07.443 --> 00:04:11.803
So let's swap this other one over to link two.

89
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.940
And now when I click on them,

90
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.040
you'll see what's happening is this is actually

91
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.760
not reloading the page.

92
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.360
We are simply just swapping out the components,

93
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.270
home and beers.

94
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.287
And then when you click on them,

95
00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:32.210
they will do, what's called HTML five push state.

96
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.460
And that will change the URL bar in there as well as

97
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.980
it gives us some

98
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.750
back history in our browser, which is pretty cool.

99
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.750
So almost always I would go as far to say as 97 point no

100
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.870
98.7% of the time,

101
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.000
you will be using a link tag

102
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.040
to change from page to page,

103
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.540
whoever there are times when you want to programmatically

104
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.540
change the pages when somebody submits a form

105
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.440
or when somebody clicks a specific button

106
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.750
or for whatever reason,

107
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.120
if you need to programmatically change the page

108
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.417
and not just rely on the user to click a link,

109
00:05:14.417 --> 00:05:17.630
then you can programmatically change.

110
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.910
So this is the difference.

111
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.790
You might hear this thrown around a lot in react land.

112
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.790
It's the difference between declarative and imperative.

113
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.270
So this is declarative, we declare how it works.

114
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.560
And then imperative is you don't declare how it works.

115
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.000
You actually write the code as to what happens

116
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.520
when something wants something else

117
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.603
as a result of something else happening like a form submit.

118
00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:48.040
So let's do a little example down here.

119
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.698
Let's do another list item that says

120
00:05:50.698 --> 00:05:53.630
that has a button inside of it.

121
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.500
And then it says,

122
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.200
click me to see Slicemasters

123
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.080
after two seconds.

124
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.340
So what we wanna do is when somebody clicks on this button,

125
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.100
we want to go to the Slicemasters page,

126
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.110
but not immediately after two seconds.

127
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.760
So what you would do in that case

128
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.910
is you have an on click handler

129
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.743
and that is with curly brackets.

130
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.960
And then we can write a function

131
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.343
that's called go to Slicemasters.

132
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.133
And then we'll just console log, go to slicers.

133
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.610
Then when somebody clicks it, we will simply say,

134
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.133
go to Slicemasters.

135
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.984
And it, see this red underline here.

136
00:06:39.984 --> 00:06:41.600
We're going to see this a lot.

137
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.360
This is the IES lint config that I have.

138
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.160
And these are super helpful because it will tell you

139
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.640
when something you're doing is potentially bad

140
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.090
for accessibility or for the functionality of our code.

141
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.040
So it says it's missing an explicit type attribute

142
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.873
for buttons.

143
00:06:57.873 --> 00:06:59.960
So buttons always need a type,

144
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.810
even though if it's just the type of button,

145
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.940
which seems odd, but it has to work like that.

146
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.773
Alright, there we go.

147
00:07:05.773 --> 00:07:07.570
So now when I click on it,

148
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.100
you see that we get this console log go to slicers.

149
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.100
So now what if I wanted to one, wait for two seconds

150
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.570
and then two change the page.

151
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.750
So let's try that.

152
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.140
So one wait for two seconds.

153
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.950
So that is a set timeout

154
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.893
and that timeout will run after two seconds.

155
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.680
And then let's just put that console log

156
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.270
instead of the inside of the set timeout.

157
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.553
So now clear my console here, click at one two.

158
00:07:39.553 --> 00:07:40.880
There we go.

159
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.570
We see the console log is popping up there, right?

160
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.500
So now how do we programmatically?

161
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.390
Well, you can also from Gatsby, you can import navigate.

162
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.530
You see that my vs code knows it's smart enough

163
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.530
to know that navigate is an export from Gatsby.

164
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.230
And then in here we can simply just say navigate,

165
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.433
and we can say to forward slash Slicemasters,

166
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.750
give to save.

167
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.340
Now watch when I click it one, two,

168
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.150
and then it changed the actual page up on here.

169
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.860
There are a couple of options.

170
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.240
Most notably the option that you might want

171
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.010
to pass here is called a replace of true.

172
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.872
And what that will do is it will actually add you to the

173
00:08:29.872 --> 00:08:31.290
browser history.

174
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.910
So if this is something that you want people to click

175
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.670
the back button to, then you want to pass replace of true.

176
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.910
So, and that will then show up in your,

177
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.006
browser history.

178
00:08:42.006 --> 00:08:45.920
So it's not all that often that I will use that,

179
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.030
also mostly because I use Gatsby for websites,

180
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.590
and this is more of a web app thing.

181
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.510
And you shouldn't be using buttons as links

182
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.530
because it's annoying.

183
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.210
You can't like right click open a new tab.

184
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.100
You can't bookmark it or anything like that.

185
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.830
So almost always you will be using the link tag,

186
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.860
whoever that API navigate is there, should you ever need it.

187
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.150
So I'm gonna back that up.

188
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.340
We don't need that actually in this entire course,

189
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.690
but I thought I would let you know exactly how that works.

190
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.410
So what I want to do now is let's modify this nav

191
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.243
just a little bit.

192
00:09:19.243 --> 00:09:20.600
So we linked to that.

193
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.670
We'll just say Hot Now we'll call the homepage Hot Now.

194
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.850
Second link we're actually not gonna put beers

195
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:26.970
in the navigation's

196
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.970
gonna be something that is just accessible via

197
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.050
other links on the page.

198
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.790
So we'll just say link to pizzas.

199
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.823
And that was a pizza menu.

200
00:09:39.957 --> 00:09:42.980
I'll have another list item with a link tag.

201
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.180
You see how handy that Emma is.

202
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.203
So I'm just hitting li and then control E to open up li.

203
00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:52.033
And then inside of that, I have a link

204
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.623
and I open that up too,

205
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.150
we are going to put the logo here.

206
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.410
So just type in logo, another list item

207
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.977
of link to Slicemasters.

208
00:10:17.854 --> 00:10:22.021
And then finally we want a link to the order page,

209
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.210
order ahead.

210
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.170
And we're going to style this all in just a little bit.

211
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.390
So now when we go to the page you see we can go

212
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:37.000
from page to page and the ones that have the navigation on,

213
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.390
we're able to, see the nav and without it changing.

214
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.853
So now we got the whole Nav up there,

215
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.840
in the next video we're going to talk a little bit more

216
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.980
about layouts,

217
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.980
so I don't need to import this nav into every single page.

218
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.960
It should just happen automatically.

219
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.753
So I'll see in that one.
