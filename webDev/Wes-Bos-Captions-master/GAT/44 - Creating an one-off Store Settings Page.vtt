00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:02.966
(cheerful music)

2
00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:06.300
<v Instructor>A pretty common thing</v>

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.570
that you wanna do in a website

4
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.370
is you wanna have like a settings page

5
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.410
where you control everything

6
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.040
from little things like headlines over to selecting content

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.800
that you wanna put on the homepage.

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.800
And these are what I like to call like, options pages

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.830
or one-off pages, meaning that

10
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.020
they still need to be stored in the database

11
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.480
just like the people, and the pizzas, and everything else,

12
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.340
but there's not gonna be multiple of them.

13
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.080
There's only going to be one page of them.

14
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.930
So, that's a pretty common thing.

15
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.620
I've done that in dozens of sites

16
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.820
for clients over the years.

17
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.690
And I thought I'd show you how to do that

18
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.730
because on the homepage,

19
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.320
I want someone to be able to go into the backend here,

20
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.390
and click on something in the sidebar,

21
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.570
and then be able to select, who is currently working

22
00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.460
and what pizzas are currently available by the slice.

23
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.720
And we wanna pull that data

24
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.250
into our front end of our website.

25
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.080
So, we're gonna be cracking open the sanity folder.

26
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.853
So, actually I gotta kill this real quick and open it up.

27
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.670
And I'm gonna run it again and PM start.

28
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.560
Right, so, we are in the sanity.

29
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.530
So, first thing we need to do is to make a schema

30
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.690
for that setting.

31
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.460
Now, the way that sanity does it

32
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.900
is no different than any other data type.

33
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.940
It allows you to create multiple versions of a,

34
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.750
I guess settings page or something like that.

35
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.640
However, we're going to restrict

36
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.850
creating multiple versions of them

37
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.290
by modifying the sidebar that we have right here.

38
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.963
Let's open up our pizza schema,

39
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.080
and just duplicate the whole sucker

40
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.640
over to storesettings.js.

41
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.390
And let's just go through each one of these things

42
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.390
line by line.

43
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.510
So, here we have, we'll say MDStore.

44
00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:09.183
We don't need our custom price input.

45
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.860
The name is going to be store settings.

46
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.340
The title is going to be capital S settings.

47
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.270
Type is the document.

48
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.490
Icon is what we imported earlier up here.

49
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.880
The fields that we have,

50
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.510
okay, so, let's just go ahead and delete all the fields

51
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.740
and actually everything else that we have.

52
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.660
So, delete all the fields,

53
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.110
and delete all the preview metadata.

54
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.190
We'll come back to that in just a second.

55
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.220
So, fields that we have.

56
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.740
First field is going to be

57
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.373
a slicemasters field.

58
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.610
The title is going to be

59
00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:51.433
slicemasters currently slicing.

60
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.420
The type is going to be an array

61
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.354
because it's gonna be an array of slicemasters.

62
00:03:03.354 --> 00:03:06.980
So, the type is an array of array type,

63
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.010
and it's going to be a reference.

64
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.810
Remember we're going to link it to a list of other ones.

65
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.747
A reference to, this is another array, hokey smokes.

66
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.520
Type of person.

67
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.820
And again, that person comes from this, which is a person.

68
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.270
You have a name of person right here.

69
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.103
Okay, good.

70
00:03:31.103 --> 00:03:32.010
So, that's a very basic.

71
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.600
Let's just make sure this is up and running.

72
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.450
Let's go into our schema.js,

73
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.733
and we will import store settings.

74
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.560
And then we'll just pop that sucker into the store settings.

75
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.450
Now, this should show up in our sanity backend.

76
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.283
There we go.

77
00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:56.320
Settings, and there are no settings,

78
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.130
and it will allow us to create

79
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.930
a new set of store settings.

80
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.497
Don't create one yet because we're gonna manually make it.

81
00:04:03.497 --> 00:04:04.550
But you can see here,

82
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.653
I'll be able to add, where's Enock?

83
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.973
Here he is.

84
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.270
And you get the point, right?

85
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.840
So, that's good.

86
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.533
Then we'll just go ahead and duplicate that field,

87
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.993
and we'll call the next one, hot slices.

88
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.400
And then we'll see,

89
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.400
hot slices available in the case.

90
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.500
And we want it to be an array to pizza.

91
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.050
And we save.

92
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.270
And this should refresh.

93
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.630
Here we go, hot slices.

94
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.630
You can select the different pizzas that show up.

95
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.810
Again, I'm on slow internet,

96
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.900
that's why it's taking a second to show up.

97
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.800
All right, so, that is our first one.

98
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.400
Let's actually pop a quick name field on here too,

99
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.260
'cause like, if you add it,

100
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.470
it like, doesn't know like,

101
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.500
what to put in this preview here.

102
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.033
So, let's just go into pizza.

103
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.563
Let's grab the name field,

104
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.857
pop it in here,

105
00:05:06.857 --> 00:05:08.650
and then just say,

106
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.250
we'll call it a store name because

107
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.250
the kind of the cool thing about this that we have here

108
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.970
is even though we are gonna be able to do a one off,

109
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.150
the whole idea is that

110
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.540
it's still a repeatable piece of content,

111
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.870
so that if you opened up a second store,

112
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.810
you wouldn't have to like, copy paste this.

113
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.760
You'd still be able to create a settings page

114
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.670
for a secondary store without much extra effort,

115
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.503
which is pretty cool.

116
00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:36.050
So, look at this.

117
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.020
We've got two of them here,

118
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.250
just cause these are saved drafts

119
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.640
just as I was talking to you, it's shown up,

120
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.950
and then we have the name.

121
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.050
You can pop the name in there.

122
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.430
Okay, cool.

123
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.480
Now, the next step that we wanna have is

124
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.460
we don't want to have the settings page here,

125
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.470
although that wouldn't be the end of the world.

126
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.193
Like, you could just say like the Hamilton store,

127
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.360
and then save that.

128
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.750
But you always like, run the chance that

129
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.957
somebody would come in here and be like,

130
00:06:03.957 --> 00:06:05.480
"Hey, I created a new store

131
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.350
'cause I couldn't figure out how to edit the old one."

132
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.670
And we don't necessarily want that.

133
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.810
We just want a settings thing in the sidebar here

134
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.300
that goes directly to this edit screen,

135
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.350
and doesn't allow the user to create multiple stores

136
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.190
and sort of get confusion like that.

137
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.950
And that's the kind of finesse that

138
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.620
I think makes a really good website,

139
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.810
and you're not gonna get calls at two in the morning

140
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.950
from an angry client cause they goofed it up.

141
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.320
So, the way that we do that is

142
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.230
just go into your sanity core here,

143
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.540
and by core, I mean just the root folder,

144
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.523
and make a sidebar.js,

145
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.410
then inside there, we're going to import react from react.

146
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.880
We're going to import capital S from,

147
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.140
and this is long.

148
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.790
So, hold onto your parts.

149
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.790
It's @sanity/desktool/structure-builder.

150
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.590
And this is just the internal sanity studio,

151
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.670
similar to how we created our own input.

152
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.560
We're now going to be using their own tool

153
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.050
to create a custom sidebar file.

154
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.700
Then before we go any further,

155
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.880
we wanna go into our sanity.json file,

156
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.880
and we need to let sanity know about this extra part

157
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.093
that we have here.

158
00:07:19.093 --> 00:07:21.660
So, you see this one part we have right here,

159
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.660
we'll put a comma after that,

160
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.850
open another set of curly brackets,

161
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.570
and we'll say the name is part:@sanity,

162
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:35.380
It's not base schema, it's desk tool/structure.

163
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.990
And sanity has a bunch of examples of this.

164
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.230
Make sure you put that in quotes

165
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.740
'cause this is JSON not JavaScript.

166
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.487
And then the path to that is going to be

167
00:07:46.487 --> 00:07:50.153
/./sidebar.js.

168
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.227
I believe we now have to,

169
00:07:55.227 --> 00:07:58.890
not sure if we need to kill the builder or not, we'll see.

170
00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.880
Well, let's try that.

171
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.500
Now, let's jump back into our sidebar,

172
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.390
and this is where we get to building our custom sidebar.

173
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.740
So, build a custom sidebar.

174
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.713
So, we'll export default function.

175
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.293
We'll call it sidebar.

176
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.763
And from that we'll return s.list.

177
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.173
And let's just kinda go through that one by one.

178
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.050
So, let's refresh this page now that we just ran s.list.

179
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.520
Doesn't look like anything has changed, okay?

180
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.830
Okay, good.

181
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.830
Then on top of that, we need a .title,

182
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:45.280
and that is Slick's Slices.

183
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.410
I'm gonna use back ticks there,

184
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.340
so, I don't have to worry about escaping it.

185
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.513
And this will give us like, a sort of,

186
00:08:51.513 --> 00:08:54.600
you see how it's just this content right now?

187
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.490
We're gonna replace that

188
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.750
with our own title called Slick's Slices.

189
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.470
And then underneath that,

190
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.840
we're gonna say the items are an array of

191
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.473
s.listitem.

192
00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:09.530
So, we're gonna create a new item.

193
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.570
Maybe I should comment this.

194
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.723
A new sub item.

195
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.720
And a chain onto that is a .title.

196
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.740
Notice how I'm not putting semi-colons on here

197
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.070
just cause we are chaining forever.

198
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.333
The title will be the homepage.

199
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.760
Let's see what that gives us so far.

200
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.470
This should at least show up.

201
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.133
And if it's not, we know we did something wrong.

202
00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:38.530
Okay, nothing's showing up yet.

203
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.423
So, I bet we need to kill our build and restart it.

204
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.893
Here we go, okay.

205
00:09:44.893 --> 00:09:45.920
So, now, that we killed it,

206
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.160
you see that we are creating a custom sidebar

207
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:50.993
that is in here.

208
00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:54.400
So, now, we just have homepage, and you click that,

209
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.660
it goes to nothing, right?

210
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.700
So, that's good 'cause we haven't finished yet.

211
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.370
So, on top of that,

212
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.683
we can chain a .icon,

213
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.520
and an icon is just an inline function

214
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.380
that returns a strong tag with a,

215
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.070
let's just put a fire emoji in there.

216
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.270
And again, you could import an icon

217
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.850
just like we did from react icons.

218
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.020
I'm just gonna show you here

219
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.340
how you can make literally any react component,

220
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.170
and it should swap itself out.

221
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.003
There we go.

222
00:10:26.003 --> 00:10:27.530
Okay, good.

223
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.960
Then the children of that.

224
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.513
So, let's say .child.

225
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.760
And inside of that s.editor

226
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.463
and .schematype.

227
00:10:46.296 --> 00:10:47.710
It's gonna be store settings.

228
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.130
Again, that lines up with this schema right here.

229
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.110
So, we're saying,

230
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.910
create an editor, like when someone clicks on it,

231
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.200
create an editor for the schema type, and

232
00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:06.138
link it to the document ID of,

233
00:11:06.138 --> 00:11:08.090
and now, what is the document ID?

234
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.690
Well, normally in our backend here,

235
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.490
let me go to one that I have right here.

236
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.020
Is if you like, go to a pizza

237
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.590
and you click on one of the pizzas,

238
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.610
the document ID is this, right?

239
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:24.090
It's just a random number that we have here.

240
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.080
However, you can

241
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.880
customize what that document ID is.

242
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.713
And in our case,

243
00:11:31.713 --> 00:11:34.320
we can just pass it a document ID that does not exist

244
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.760
and it will just create it for us.

245
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.700
So, make a new document ID

246
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.700
so we don't have a random string of numbers.

247
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.900
So, the document ID is going to just be,

248
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.080
we'll call it downtown.

249
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.660
Like that's the downtown location.

250
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.520
I got a red.

251
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.470
There should be a dot in front of that.

252
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.520
And I would take a look at what we got.

253
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.240
It's opened it up.

254
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.720
It looks like it's picking up the data

255
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.120
that I was working with earlier.

256
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.473
So, let's go and just nuke that, delete it.

257
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.993
And let's delete this one as well.

258
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.420
Oh, no, there we go.

259
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.890
You see, if there are no documents,

260
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.950
it will then create a new one for you,

261
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.020
which is what we want

262
00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.580
and it will give it the ID of downtown.

263
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.430
That's good.

264
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.880
And then the other thing we wanna do is just like

265
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.010
add in the rest

266
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.630
of our document items.

267
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.463
And in this case,

268
00:12:38.463 --> 00:12:41.500
we don't need to manually do all this huge song and dance.

269
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.935
We can simply just say

270
00:12:42.935 --> 00:12:44.593
...s.documenttypelistitems.

271
00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:48.000
So, document type list items.

272
00:12:53.217 --> 00:12:56.117
And that should populate the rest of the...

273
00:12:56.117 --> 00:12:57.090
Oh, there we go.

274
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.460
Pizzas topping slice masters,

275
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.630
and now it still shows us settings.

276
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.690
So, we'll have to do one more thing

277
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.510
and actually remove that settings value from here

278
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.270
because we don't want anyone to actually see this interface.

279
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.860
We only want them to be able to edit the homepage data

280
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.580
from the sidebar here.

281
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.760
And the way that we do that is

282
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.810
because this just returns an array,

283
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.593
we can just do a regular filter on that.

284
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.900
And we will say for each item that it returns,

285
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.010
check if the item.id,

286
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.180
so, we run item.getid

287
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.860
is not equal to,

288
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.573
in our case, it's store settings.

289
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.880
And that should just filter out a list of all of them.

290
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.230
This will rebuild and that should be gone forever.

291
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.470
Beautiful, okay.

292
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.650
So, now, let's just say like, downtown store.

293
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.100
Let's add a couple slice masters currently slicing.

294
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.173
Ooh, what's this?

295
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.010
Must be a reference to a document.

296
00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:58.923
It is.

297
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.533
Good.

298
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.240
Close ad.

299
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.960
So, I'm just gonna go ahead and fill this out

300
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.700
with four pizzas and four people.

301
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.850
And the next video we'll look at

302
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.500
pulling those into the front end.

303
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.500
All right, I've got my four values here

304
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.770
and I can always go to it by clicking on the homepage.

305
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:24.840
All right, so, that's that.

306
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.673
In the next video,

307
00:14:25.673 --> 00:14:27.553
we'll look at pulling them into the front end.
