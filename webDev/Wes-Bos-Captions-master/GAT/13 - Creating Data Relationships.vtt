00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.667
(bells chiming)

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.710
<v Instructor>Go back to your pizzas here</v>

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.283
and take that one pizza that we've created here.

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.463
And let's name it a pepperoni.

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.010
Actually let's call it master pizza.

6
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.050
We're gonna put all of the toppings on this one.

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.740
Go ahead and update that.

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.680
Now you see there is a price input.

9
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.370
There is a slug, there is a name,

10
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.620
but there's no way to select what toppings go on that pizza.

11
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.480
So let's open up the schema for our pizza.

12
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.780
So pizza.js,

13
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.160
and let's go down to the fields array

14
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.550
and we'll go,

15
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.140
where should we go here?

16
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's go right under...

17
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.260
Let's go to the end, okay.

18
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.580
Make sure you have a comma there

19
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.310
and give yourself a new object.

20
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.513
Now the name of this is going to be toppings.

21
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.713
The title, it's going to be a capital T, Toppings.

22
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.530
The type is going to be, what is it?

23
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.713
Like the type of it is,

24
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.360
well, it's a relational content and we could,

25
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.400
in this case, just go have a reference to topping.

26
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.410
But in our case, we wanna have a one to many relationships.

27
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.710
So we want an array of references.

28
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.623
So we'll say the type is array.

29
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.243
And then we have an of,

30
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.680
let's look at the docs for this right now.

31
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.680
So go back to the docs here, go to references, schema types,

32
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.993
and we'll go to array.

33
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.040
You'll see that it allows you to select multiple

34
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.350
in their case they have an array of people

35
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.530
that are like in a movie or something like that.

36
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.523
So the type and of,

37
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.380
and they got a really simple version here of type of string.

38
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.470
So we could do that.

39
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.490
So we can say of array.

40
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.190
And now we're just doing like another one of these.

41
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.550
We're just doing another array of fields.

42
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.550
So in here I can say array of type string.

43
00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:12.813
Let's, let's see what that looks like when we do it.

44
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.010
Here we go, toppings, add so pepperoni

45
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.310
and mushrooms, and we'd go ahead and publish that.

46
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.900
Now, the reason why we're not going to be doing that

47
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.730
is because these are not related

48
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.220
to the actual toppings type.

49
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.610
And if I were to make an update to the pepperoni type,

50
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.430
there's no connection between the two.

51
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.830
Like maybe I wanted to like put a capital P on that.

52
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.663
If that was the case,

53
00:02:45.663 --> 00:02:47.313
then it would have to go through every single pizza

54
00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:48.870
that has that pepperoni.

55
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.150
And we don't want to do that.

56
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.450
We wanna relate it to topping.

57
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.070
So if I make a change to pepperoni's display name,

58
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.050
or if I upload a new photo for a pepperoni

59
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.883
or anything like that,

60
00:02:57.883 --> 00:03:00.420
it will be updated for every pizza that has that topping.

61
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.420
So one kinda cool thing about sanity is if you were to,

62
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.664
now that I just like added data and saved it.

63
00:03:08.664 --> 00:03:11.030
If you were to change this,

64
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.230
it would notice that you have data saved in the database,

65
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.010
but then that no longer,

66
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.910
no longer has a field of string.

67
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.870
And it will tell you, you can delete that data yourself,

68
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.450
but in our case, let's just go ahead

69
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.590
and delete those two things.

70
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.490
If you did it and publish it.

71
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.280
So we don't have any ghost data that's inaccessible.

72
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.500
So our case is not a type of string.

73
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.322
It's going to be a type of,

74
00:03:33.322 --> 00:03:36.690
well, let's go to the types, reference, right?

75
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.480
So we're kinda using two different field types here.

76
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.400
We're having an array of a special type,

77
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.950
which is a reference.

78
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.140
So we'll say type of reference

79
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.860
and we wanna reference it to,

80
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.090
and in this case, it's really cool.

81
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.120
Normally you think, okay, just reference to topping,

82
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.560
but you can have reference to multiple types.

83
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.230
So if you had like toppings and sauces,

84
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.240
maybe you wanted to sauces versus own type.

85
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.170
You could do that.

86
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.653
So in our case it's going to be an array again,

87
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.730
with a type of topping.

88
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.400
And where do I get that topping from?

89
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.810
Well, that is the name of our topping.

90
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.430
So that's linked right here.

91
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.950
That's really important there.

92
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.210
So a type of array,

93
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.210
it's an array of references that reference topping.

94
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.520
We'll give it a save, go here.

95
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.170
Now, when you click add it pops this up

96
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.873
and I can type something like P-E, pepperoni pops up,

97
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.730
and this is a little confusing to me.

98
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.570
Cause you think it's like added.

99
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.490
So you think you could close, you can do it again.

100
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.360
You can't add multiples as of right now,

101
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.510
I talked to the team myself.

102
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.400
So it was like onions.

103
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.333
But if you were to do another one like mushrooms,

104
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.890
you see it just deleted onion.

105
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.450
So you have to add one, close it, open it up again.

106
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.620
Then we'll put onions in there and finally bacon.

107
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.373
Go ahead and hit publish.

108
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.020
All right, so now this pepperoni,

109
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.380
You'll see that, that the media

110
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.760
is actually already showing up.

111
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.970
It just detected that we had an image field

112
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.310
and it starts to show it in there.

113
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.620
However, we do have control over that.

114
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.511
And ideally, what I would like to do

115
00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:35.980
is underneath this pizza is list

116
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.580
a couple of the toppings that that pizza has.

117
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.590
So let's add one more pizza here

118
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.770
and we'll call it veggie delight, generate a slug for it.

119
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.000
I'm gonna upload an image.

120
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.830
I may say Jimmy Hendrix.

121
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.390
We have some really neat names for these coming up.

122
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.450
The price of it is $22 and 56 cents.

123
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.070
And then the toppings are just our two vegetarian ones,

124
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.320
which is mushroom and onion.

125
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.550
I realize that's probably not a very good pizza,

126
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.480
but we'll get
(laughing loudly)

127
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.970
some more toppings in a bit.

128
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.410
Go ahead and publish it.

129
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.520
Alright, so now I'm looking at these pizzas

130
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.260
and if I'm the editor, this is not even our website,

131
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.870
but if I'm editing it, I would like to see what toppings

132
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.620
are on the pizza just as a quick glance.

133
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.600
So what we can do here is we can create a custom preview

134
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.950
on our pizza just as we did on our toppings yes.

135
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.520
I'll go down to your pizza all the way to the bottom here.

136
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.703
And we will give ourselves a preview property.

137
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.980
And remember the preview has our select and our prepare.

138
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.940
So what fields do we wanna select?

139
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.030
What we want, the title, which is the name we want...

140
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.530
Oh, in our case, I said, name last time

141
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.860
in this case, I'm saying title.

142
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.720
It doesn't matter what you call them.

143
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.430
It's just, that's what it's going to be called

144
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.450
in your preview function.

145
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.960
So maybe that's good that I switched them up

146
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.720
just to show you that it doesn't really matter.

147
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.750
There's nothing special there.

148
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.750
We also want the media and that will be the image field.

149
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.900
And then we want all of the toppings.

150
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.150
Now, normally I thought like, okay, just say,

151
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.670
topping is going to be the toppings field, right?

152
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.110
And the way you can tell what your like,

153
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.610
sort of debug these things is,

154
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.803
if you go down under select and we say, prepare,

155
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.683
we want, let's just do fields.

156
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.630
And then we'll return pizza name

157
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.633
and then let's console log, the fields.

158
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.000
So we have our prepare function that takes in our fields

159
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.910
and we're on the console log to fields

160
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.743
and then return the pizza named.

161
00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.913
As you open your up your dev tools here.

162
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.460
You might see a whole bunch of stuff.

163
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.100
So maybe refresh and see what we got here.

164
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.320
So this is kind of a bummer that Firefox

165
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.153
does this all the time.

166
00:08:09.153 --> 00:08:12.360
Anytime you have a web socket and you're like,

167
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.360
reload the page like complains about the web socket,

168
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.453
not being able to close properly.

169
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.510
That's half Firefox, half the actual library.

170
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.743
So you just have to ignore that, unfortunately.

171
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.790
So here we go.

172
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.350
So there's all kinds of junk in here.

173
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.140
Just wade through it until you find your thing,

174
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.900
pizza JS line 56, good.

175
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.350
And then you will see that the fields that we got,

176
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:45.350
are media, which is our image we see in the asset,

177
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.460
they have the reference to the image ID.

178
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.633
They have a topping and then they have the toppings array.

179
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.790
But in this case,

180
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.240
you'll see that it just gives us a reference

181
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.240
to the actual thing, because that is a reference

182
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.180
to another type.

183
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.840
It doesn't give us the actual name.

184
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.960
So in order to select the topping name,

185
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.770
cause I don't care about the key or the reference ID here.

186
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.870
I want the actual name like pepperoni or mushroom.

187
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.640
We have to select it like this.

188
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.560
It's a little bit weird,

189
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.470
but also in the docs, it says just select what you need.

190
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.770
Don't select an entire array because you could be

191
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.410
unnecessarily fetching data.

192
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.820
So not toppings is going to be topping zero

193
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.200
and it's toppings.0.name.

194
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.000
So it's saying select the toppings array,

195
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.220
then grab the first thing and then grab the name.

196
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.300
That's not JavaScript, but that's the, just the syntax

197
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.270
that sanity studio is using.

198
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.110
And then we're just gonna select the first four toppings

199
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.570
because we don't, if the pizza has a hundred toppings,

200
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.840
we can't display that in there, right?

201
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.000
So we'll do that.

202
00:09:57.459 --> 00:09:59.370
(beeping)

203
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:04.370
Let's see if I can use my text pastry one to X.

204
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:11.370
No, that didn't work, but I think I can do this delete text.

205
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.560
This is a little extension.

206
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.810
There we go called text pastry.

207
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.210
And if you have cursors, you can just say text pressure,

208
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.540
you one to X and everywhere there's a cursor

209
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.030
we'll insert one, two, three, four,

210
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.863
and did that.

211
00:10:25.863 --> 00:10:28.743
And then I can just use my cursors to do the same thing.

212
00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:31.399
There we go.

213
00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:33.090
Yeah, I'm being a hot shot there.

214
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.703
You can certainly just go and type it yourself.

215
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.460
I just like to flex a little bit.

216
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.590
Now, if we refresh this page, here we go.

217
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.765
You see veggie delight, topping zero.

218
00:10:46.765 --> 00:10:49.990
Here we go to topping one, topping two, topping three.

219
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.830
So those are undefined because

220
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.320
they don't have more than two toppings.

221
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.350
So one little trick I like to do here

222
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.280
is we could destructure all of them, like this.

223
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.070
So we could say title media toppings,

224
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:11.070
zero topping one, topping two, topping three.

225
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.270
And then we could just console log

226
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.073
all those variables like this,

227
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.540
and that will work.

228
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.378
So here we go, mushrooms, onions, undefined, undefined,

229
00:11:24.378 --> 00:11:27.723
but one kind of little cool thing is you can use,

230
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.150
a rest pram and a function to destructure the things

231
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.560
that you want title in media.

232
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.680
And then you can use the three little dots to capture

233
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.340
the rest of the arguments into an object.

234
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.340
And the way we can do that is we delete all these.

235
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.023
And we simply say ...toppings.

236
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.210
And by saying that if we say anything else

237
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.010
that we haven't already destructured,

238
00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.800
just stick it in an object called toppings.

239
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.150
And that's kinda cool because we know the rest

240
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.480
of the things are just toppings.

241
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.330
So we could just,

242
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.020
now, if you log toppings like that,

243
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.140
now, if you open it up, you'll see,

244
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.260
we have an object here with the rest of the toppings,

245
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.360
which is kind of cool.

246
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.640
So next thing we wanted to do is take care

247
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.190
of these undefined.

248
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.280
So let's write a little bit of comments here.

249
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.280
So one, just like filter undefined toppings out,

250
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:31.363
and then two, return the preview object

251
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.290
for the pizza.

252
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.010
So let's actually do two first.

253
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.100
So return an object where the title

254
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.320
is equal to the title property.

255
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.033
So I saved that it just does that.

256
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:48.973
Actually, no,

257
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.830
you see my prettier made it an implicit return.

258
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.760
I don't want that.

259
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.763
So I'm just gonna go into the logs stay.

260
00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:57.783
Okay, good.

261
00:12:57.783 --> 00:12:59.230
So we returned the title property

262
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.293
and we also returned the media property.

263
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.870
So you see it's as visually delayed already,

264
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.850
that should change to a thumbnail, good.

265
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.130
And then we also have the option

266
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.493
to put a subtitle, like this.

267
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.760
You see there's a subtitle there

268
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.003
so we can take our toppings,

269
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.573
join them with a comma and a space.

270
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.893
And it broke, what happened?

271
00:13:31.832 --> 00:13:34.320
Heads up, got an error while preparing preview,

272
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.760
click for details.

273
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.810
It's nice, thank you.

274
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.303
Encountered an error.

275
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.370
Toppings that join is not a function.

276
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:48.370
Oh, obviously, because toppings is an object.

277
00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.390
So if you want all the values,

278
00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.763
you would have to wrap that in it, object.values.

279
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.427
And that will turn it from an object into an array.

280
00:13:58.427 --> 00:14:00.870
And we only care about the,

281
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.180
we only care about the values here.

282
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.850
We don't care about the properties,

283
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.840
which is these four right here.

284
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.800
And then there we go.

285
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.650
That's actually looking pretty good.

286
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.740
We've got mushrooms, onions, except for that like little,

287
00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.790
the undefined ones have this extra little space here.

288
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.270
So the way that we can do that is we'll create

289
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.700
another variable up here.

290
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.700
We'll say const tops is equal to object.values, toppings,

291
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.553
and then we can just filter it for if it is falcy,

292
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.600
meaning if it is undefined, it will filter itself out.

293
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.600
And we could just, normally you would say like topping,

294
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:48.530
topping is equal to undefined or not equal to undefined.

295
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.640
So if the topic is not undefined, then we want to keep it.

296
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.030
So we're filtering it.

297
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.330
And I actually tweeted that and someone's like,

298
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.750
well, you can just filter Boolean.

299
00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.400
And what that will do is it will,

300
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.093
if you have Boolean, this.

301
00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.680
Boolean,

302
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.180
if you have undefined, it returned false.

303
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.340
If you have a mushroom, it will turn true.

304
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.800
And it will also also filter out some nice things

305
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.660
if you have like a topping, that is just a space,

306
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.803
something went wrong.

307
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.250
Oh actually, no, that's wrong.
(laughing loudly)

308
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.140
It will keep it if it is a space,

309
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.600
what if it is a topping of zero?

310
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.540
No, so if you have a topic of zero, it will filter it out.

311
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.940
Don't know why you would have that

312
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.480
but that is just a way to convert

313
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.250
a value into a true Boolean.

314
00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.020
So we filter them out there and then we'll go down here

315
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.370
and replace this object.values with our new array,

316
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.700
which is tops or pizzas.

317
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.667
Here we go, mushrooms, onions, pepperoni, mushrooms,

318
00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:55.150
and onions bacon.

319
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.983
Beautiful.

320
00:15:55.983 --> 00:15:58.530
So a little bit extra work here,

321
00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.953
but a nice control over how it looks in our sanity studio.
