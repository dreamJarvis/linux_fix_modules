00:00:00.091 --> 00:00:02.674
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Instructor>All right, now we're gonna look</v>

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.780
at styling our nav with styled components

4
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.140
and it's gonna teach you all about how to scope our styles.

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.980
So let's open up this nav.js here.

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.490
And first thing I wanna to do

7
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.600
is we are going to make a styled component.

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.600
So the way that you do that is you make your own component,

9
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.920
looks like this const.

10
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.430
And I always like to call it like NavStyles.

11
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.597
I always like to put the word styles at the end of it.

12
00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:34.600
And that way, when you go ahead and use that component,

13
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.500
you know that that is a styled component.

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.109
That's just personal preference, you don't have to do that.

15
00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.500
You say styled. and then you give it

16
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.040
the type of element that you want.

17
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.090
So styled.div, styled.a,

18
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.490
in our case, it's going to be a nav element.

19
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.760
And then inside of that,

20
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.750
we just go ahead and write all of the CSS,

21
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.240
which we wish for it to be applied to our nav.

22
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.000
So say, let's just say background red.

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.030
Now we need to import the styled nav here,

24
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.050
and you see it's imported.

25
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.340
And we import styles from styled components

26
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.230
so that just did my auto import there.

27
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.970
Now that's not gonna work just yet,

28
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.820
but now what we need to do is we need to take

29
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.970
that nav element that we created just this

30
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.980
and replace it with our new styled component.

31
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.680
So I'm just going to replace that.

32
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.030
And you'll notice that the closing one also

33
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.250
has updated itself.

34
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.090
That is using my plugin.

35
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.373
That's called, what is it called?

36
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.080
Rename, auto renamed tag.

37
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.080
Yeah, auto rename tag is the one that you need to do that.

38
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.300
Now we'll go back to our app.

39
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.600
You'll see it as red.

40
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.040
I could change that to green

41
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.780
and it does.

42
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.260
Hot reload it, which is really cool.

43
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.840
But if you don't see it hot reloading,

44
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.210
there was some issues temporarily with hot reloading.

45
00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.630
If you do not see it, just go over

46
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.440
and give it a quick refresh.

47
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.630
So now the kind of coolest thing about that

48
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.630
is any styles that we put inside of this style right here

49
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.750
will not be applied to anywhere else on our website.

50
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.970
So we can do things like go ahead and just grab links a

51
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.370
and say, background red and it'll turn everything red.

52
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.000
Now, if I have a link somewhere else in my website,

53
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.483
maybe in, let's just do a link here.

54
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.930
You'll notice that that link does not have background red,

55
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.500
and I didn't have to add like a specific class

56
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.790
or anything to that link.

57
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.890
I just use a very simple selector.

58
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.890
So any link that is inside of this nav element

59
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.760
will be colored red, everything else on the page, won't be.

60
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.740
So that is the difference between our global styles,

61
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.860
which we did in our global styles that JS file

62
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.410
and our scope styles,

63
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.470
which we'll do of the course in.

64
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.090
Other thing to get about this is you'll see here

65
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.610
I'm just starting to go ahead and write styles

66
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.470
that is applied to the main element.

67
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.070
Now, if you wanna style something

68
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.450
that is within that element, you just give it a selector.

69
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.070
So my personal philosophy for this type of thing

70
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.070
is to make your major components, your nav, your footer,

71
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.360
your sidebar, your person,

72
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.150
make those main components style.

73
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.330
And then just use selectors to grab

74
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.100
the things inside of those.

75
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.130
And like, if I wanted to style this unordered list,

76
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.730
there's kind of two ways I could do that.

77
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.380
I could, we'll delete that, we don't need that.

78
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.503
We could grab the UL, we could say border when PX solid red,

79
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.160
and you'll see that there's a red border around that.

80
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160
Or I could also do const ulstyles = styled.ul.

81
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.980
And I put the border 10 PX, solid yellow in there.

82
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.790
And then if I wanted to use those UL styles,

83
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.797
I would just go and replace this UL tag with our component.

84
00:04:12.797 --> 00:04:14.860
And that would go ahead and then apply them too,

85
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.920
so two different ways to do it.

86
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.310
You would use that separate component

87
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.840
if that, the styled component needs to be reused

88
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.640
multiple times throughout your website.

89
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.050
So maybe you wanted this style to apply it

90
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.530
to the one in the nav,

91
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.610
but you also wanted to apply the same styles

92
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.950
as something in the footer and in the sidebar,

93
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.140
if that's the case,

94
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.470
you need to make a reusable style.

95
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.310
And in my case,

96
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.930
I often opt for just putting it as a child selector.

97
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.763
And then I say,

98
00:04:43.763 --> 00:04:47.430
ah, I need to reuse this style over and over again.

99
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.810
So if that's the case,

100
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.430
then I'll take it out of a child selector

101
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.500
and move into this style, which is its own component.

102
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.630
So we'll go through that a couple more times in this course,

103
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.233
deciding which one makes sense.

104
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.100
So let's go ahead now and start to,

105
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.600
okay, I move that back to you.

106
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.240
Let's go ahead and start actually styling up

107
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.550
this navigation here.

108
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.720
So remove everything that we have in there.

109
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.363
First thing is margin bottom.

110
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.940
We wanna have three REM and this is just for future layout,

111
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.810
you'll see why.

112
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.380
Then we wanna grab that unordered list in there.

113
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.983
Say margin zero, padding zero,

114
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.630
padding is zero.

115
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.340
And again, I'm just using Emmett there

116
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.160
and expanding it on the abbreviation there.

117
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.420
I'm gonna display display grid,

118
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.653
grid template, columns.

119
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.780
If we look at the final version,

120
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.470
you'll see, we have this big logo in the middle.

121
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.030
We have two links to the left and two links to the right.

122
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.780
So in order to do that, we wanna say 1fr, 1fr.

123
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.130
Those are the two, auto.

124
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.310
So the logo we'll take up as much space as that needs to.

125
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.600
And then 1fr, 1fr for each of those.

126
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.410
So if we give that a save, you'll see

127
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.560
it doesn't look very good right now,

128
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.000
but you will see that the logo,

129
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.360
once we bring it in we'll show there.

130
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.493
Text-align, center,

131
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.223
list style, none.

132
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.240
That'll take those little dots off in front of the elements,

133
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.820
our grid gap, I like to put my grid stuff together.

134
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.820
So grid gap, let's do 2rem and that's going to be 20PX.

135
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.600
Cause if we look at our layout here,

136
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.190
or what's our global styles.

137
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.190
On the HTML, I put a font size of 10PX and that's our base.

138
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.850
And then anytime we use rems throughout the application,

139
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.900
it will be two times the base, which is 20PX.

140
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.113
That's kinda one way I like to go about it.

141
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.350
Align items, this is more CSS grid stuff.

142
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.480
Maybe let's bring the CSS grid stuff to the bottom.

143
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.380
Here we go.

144
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.363
Line items, center.

145
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.030
Margin top is going to be

146
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.900
well actually we'll add that on later

147
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.420
because we don't have our logo in just yet.

148
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.570
So let's see how that's looking.

149
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.603
Pretty, pretty, pretty good.

150
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.470
I like it.

151
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.070
Okay, so we've got that,

152
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.810
next up we want to just tilt each

153
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.310
of these list items a little bit.

154
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.270
So I'm going to select the list item.

155
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.500
Now you notice I'm not going to select

156
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.060
the li inside of here.

157
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.770
You can do that in styled components.

158
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.070
That's very much a SAS thing

159
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.850
where you can nest your components.

160
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.950
But what I found is if you unnecessarily nest,

161
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.640
then the selector is gonna be nav, ul, li.

162
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.085
That's three levels deep.

163
00:07:43.085 --> 00:07:46.760
And when it comes to media queries or overwriting

164
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.510
that CSS somewhere else, it gets a little tough.

165
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.110
So I like to not go very deep if I don't have to.

166
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.010
And the beauty of the styled components

167
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.380
is I can just select li and that

168
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.073
will only select the li inside of our nav.

169
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.243
So we're going to put a transform on it,

170
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.803
and I'm going to say rotate.

171
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.930
It's going to be,

172
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.030
I got to start with -2 degrees on each of them.

173
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.000
And we also want to put an order of one on it,

174
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.460
and that's gonna help us out when we hit

175
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.540
our media queries later on.

176
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.210
So you see now each of these ones

177
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.950
are tilt, tilt, tilt, tilt, okay.

178
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.010
And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna overwrite

179
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.570
this rotate value on each of them.

180
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:40.570
So I can say li:nth child one, that'll grab the first one.

181
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.330
And if I wanna overwrite the rotate,

182
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.580
I could simply just duplicate this

183
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.580
and apply like a 1.2 degree rotation on that.

184
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.710
And that's that one you see right there is tilted

185
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.750
separately from the rest of them.

186
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.360
However, the kind of tricky thing about transform

187
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.980
is that if you also had like a translateY or a skew

188
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.040
or any of the other transform properties in there,

189
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.810
then simply adding a new transform on here

190
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.920
will overwrite it.

191
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.083
Like let's watch this, scale, 4.

192
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.810
You see how all of these are scaled,

193
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:25.320
but just because I had overwritten the rotate value,

194
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.970
the scale here is no longer kicking in.

195
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.740
So one way around that is you can use CSS variables

196
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.450
and just overwrite the variables instead

197
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.960
of redoing the property each time.

198
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.490
So we'll say rotate = -2 degrees.

199
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.563
And then here, we'll say var --rotate,

200
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.100
and then inside of our transform,

201
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.810
we actually get rid of that entirely

202
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.710
and simply just update the variable

203
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.203
by saying rotate = one degree.

204
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.270
And look at that, now the scale,

205
00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.510
obviously we don't wanna scale it,

206
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.160
but the scale value is still being intact

207
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.580
while you simply are just updating the rotate.

208
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.340
That's a really nice little trick that I like to do in CSS.

209
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.021
So we have that, I could have also done

210
00:10:12.021 --> 00:10:17.021
&amp;:nth child, 1--rotate one degree,

211
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.080
actually let's do that.

212
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.340
Let's do that.

213
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.530
I don't need to make a new selector every single time.

214
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.820
This is fine.

215
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.050
So that's the first one.

216
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.900
We'll do it again for the second one.

217
00:10:30.962 --> 00:10:35.962
It's -2.5 degrees.

218
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.800
Let's do it for the third one.

219
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.520
Actually the third one will be the logo.

220
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.340
So we're not rotating that at all.

221
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.283
So we'll do it for the fourth one, which is four,

222
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.003
we'll say it's 2.5 degrees,

223
00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.853
and then we won't do it for the last one,

224
00:10:58.853 --> 00:11:03.320
because it will just take the default rotate that we have.

225
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.110
Good, let's go ahead and select all of the anchor links

226
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.350
inside of the head as well.

227
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.863
Say font size, 3rem,

228
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.583
text decoration, none.

229
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.260
And then when somebody hovers it, it will say,

230
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.803
and hover,

231
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.730
the color is going to be the red color

232
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.540
that we declared earlier up.

233
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.900
So, boom, boom, boom.

234
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.170
That's looking pretty good.

235
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.743
You could also, again,

236
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.780
you could, in here, you could say,

237
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.780
and hover rotate three degrees,

238
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.090
see how they all kind of boop, boop, boop, boop.

239
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.923
Let's keep that.

240
00:11:50.923 --> 00:11:51.756
I like that.

241
00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:54.410
That's kind of fun to see it move.

242
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.560
One thing you can't do,

243
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.460
I always, I thought this would be cool

244
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:02.460
is you could say like calc the rotate value

245
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.340
that is currently set plus 0.5 degrees,

246
00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.173
but you can't do that.

247
00:12:08.173 --> 00:12:11.970
You can't reference a variable when you're setting it

248
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.770
to a variable, you can override a variable,

249
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.420
but you can't reference itself,

250
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.800
which kind of sucks much like JavaScript you can.

251
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.700
So, and we'll just have to settle

252
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.363
with putting it on three degrees.

253
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.670
That's good for now.

254
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.870
We'll come back at a certain point and media query it up,

255
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.630
but for now I'm pretty happy with that.

256
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.230
The last thing we need to do is to bring in the logo.

257
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.470
And I'm going to ask you just to go ahead

258
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.900
and pull that from the final files,

259
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.930
because let me show you what are the moves involved

260
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.800
in getting that logo to work.

261
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.170
So GitHub, wes nos.

262
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.987
So go to the finished files, gatsby, source

263
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:55.783
styles,

264
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.013
components,

265
00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.640
and we'll find our logo here.

266
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.413
We'll go into our components here and make a logo.JS,

267
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.453
and let's just grab the raw.

268
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.350
And this is why I'm not gonna type it with you.

269
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.850
Cause it would take forever.

270
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.183
Let's start with the actual component itself.

271
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.650
You'll see, I have logo styles, which is up here.

272
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.300
It's just a styled div then inside of it,

273
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.370
we've got our ever since 1994,

274
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.700
we have our h1, it says slick slices.

275
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.300
And then I've wrapped each of the slicks

276
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.963
with a different class.

277
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.380
And we also have given this a class name here.

278
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.250
And the reason why we're doing that is because logo styles

279
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.560
are all scoped inside of here.

280
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.910
But if I wanna be able to control the size of the logo

281
00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:00.600
from within the nav, in that case, we do need a class on it.

282
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.480
Then in our styles here, this is kind of cool.

283
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.423
Let's actually pop it into the nav first.

284
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.923
So we'll go to our nav.

285
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.233
We will go here.

286
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.660
And just where it says the word logo,

287
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.713
we'll put in our logo component.

288
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.233
And then we will try to auto import that.

289
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.140
Doesn't seem to work the first time.

290
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.120
How about the second time?

291
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.710
That seemed to work.

292
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:33.550
If you go to the top,

293
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.390
you'll see that we imported logo from logo

294
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.600
and you'll see it's popping in there,

295
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.640
which is pretty cool.

296
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.660
Now this, I thought this was really cool.

297
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.660
So this, the font size of the logo styles is using clamp,

298
00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:55.520
meaning that it is at a minimum one pixel size

299
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.030
at a maximum eight pixel size.

300
00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:03.030
And then in between a 0.65 VW

301
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.550
meaning that as you resize your browser,

302
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.070
you'll see the logo will scale along with the browser size,

303
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.300
which is really cool.

304
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.950
Clamp is pretty nifty and then everything else

305
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:19.600
is using M's and M's are based upon the font size

306
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.067
of the element that was done.

307
00:15:23.067 --> 00:15:26.620
And it's cool because what can be done with this

308
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.710
is if you were to change any of these,

309
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:32.923
if we just say like font size, 20 PX,

310
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.630
the whole logo scales up accordingly.

311
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.910
And I don't have to, even though the width

312
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.860
and the height and the background size

313
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.110
and what else, font size, letter spacing,

314
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.990
all of this stuff has done in M's,

315
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.500
it's all based on this one value.

316
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.840
And we could have also used CSS calc for that,

317
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.540
but I thought that was a pretty good use case

318
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.390
for just using M's in there.

319
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.720
And when, if I ever want to scale up or down the logo,

320
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.280
I can do that.

321
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.080
Okay, let's go back to our nav here.

322
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.910
We wanna move it down,

323
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.930
then let's go ahead and grab that logo.

324
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.580
So go into your back to your nav styles.

325
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.890
Let's just select the logo in here.

326
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.890
Maybe actually let's do that at the top.

327
00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:24.747
Let's say transform, translateY -25%.

328
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.860
What that does is it moves it and gives it a base

329
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.640
at the bottom without adjusting any margin or padding.

330
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.950
And then we'll take this.

331
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.450
Then when we do the rest of our layout,

332
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.350
we will bump this down a little bit.

333
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:50.330
So it's not hiding underneath, but that's enough for now.

334
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.710
I know these styled ones are going to be a bit longer.

335
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.140
So if you rather just go ahead and copy paste the styles,

336
00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.680
all of them from GitHub by all means,

337
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.600
go ahead and do that whenever we get into the CSS parts.

338
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.400
But I know a lot of you wanna know about little tricks,

339
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.050
like translateY and using CSS variables

340
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.310
instead of overriding properties.

341
00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.030
So I'm gonna include that in this course.

342
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.580
I'll catch you in the next one.
