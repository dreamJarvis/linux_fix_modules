00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:02.712
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Instructor>So what if you want to host your Gatsby site</v>

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.550
on like a server that you already have.

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.240
So, more than likely, you have some server

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.010
you're paying a couple of bucks a month for

6
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.460
whether that's DigitalOcean or whether that's some sort

7
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.220
of Bluehost or GoDaddy or, I'm not judging you right now,

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.230
but everybody's got one of these servers there.

9
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.063
They're kicking around.

10
00:00:23.063 --> 00:00:24.830
You've got a couple of sites hosted on the thing,

11
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.480
and you just want to host your Gatsby website on it.

12
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.370
Totally doable.

13
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.770
So what I do is, I just got this bosstype.com,

14
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.620
which is just a server that I use for my company.

15
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.900
I've got a couple of WordPress projects on it and what not,

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.850
and I just made a folder called pizza.

17
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.450
Now, in order to run your Gatsby website on a subfolder,

18
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.230
you need to change the build slightly

19
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.630
so that it won't run on bosstype.com,

20
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.230
but it'll be bosstype.com/pizza.

21
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.070
So the way that we do that is open up your gatsby.

22
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.580
We'll open up our gatsby-config.js,

23
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.870
and in our export default here,

24
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.683
we're going to put a pathPrefix that is /pizza,

25
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.240
and then we simply run,

26
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.870
npm run build,

27
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.520
but in this case, we need to pass an additional flag,

28
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.510
so that it will build with the prefix

29
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.760
on all the links that we have.

30
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.593
So, the way that we do that is normally it's --prefix-paths,

31
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.290
but, in our case, we're already running npm run build,

32
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.886
so in order to pass arguments, you have to say

33
00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:39.823
<v ->- --prefix-paths,</v>

34
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060
and you can see that it passed that prefix-paths

35
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.643
along to gatsby build.

36
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.590
Once it's built that whole thing, open up your ftp client.

37
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.170
I'm using Transmit here.

38
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.320
Go into your gatsby folder, go into your public folder,

39
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.170
select everything in there, drag, drop, go grab a coffee

40
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.860
'cause this will take, I don't know, five or six minutes.

41
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.400
The output of the gatsby build is not necessarily large,

42
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.860
but ftp only uploads a couple of files at once,

43
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.400
so it needs to do the whole connect, upload, handshake,

44
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.470
close down.

45
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.270
That's why uploading lots

46
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.350
of very small files can sometimes take a while,

47
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.300
so I'll pause it, and I'll come back once this is uploaded.

48
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.260
All right, that finished uploading.

49
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.920
Refresh this sucker, boom!

50
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.300
Fonts are loading.

51
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.650
Images are loading.

52
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.430
You will need to add bosstype.com or your domain name

53
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.430
to the allowed origins on your Sanity Studio,

54
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.840
but again, we've gone through that a couple of times,

55
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.137
so I'm not gonna show you how to do that.

56
00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:52.190
All right, let's click through.

57
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.063
Make sure all these URLs are working.

58
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.920
Looks good, looks good.

59
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.960
I like it.

60
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.930
Oh, one little thing is it's looking

61
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.700
like the favicon is looking for forward slash,

62
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.080
and that's probably because of our meta,

63
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.870
what was that called?

64
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.343
Let's look in that layout.

65
00:03:18.384 --> 00:03:21.051
ContentStyles, is it in the nav?

66
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.130
It's in our SEO.

67
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.223
This, right here, is linking, so you'd have to modify that

68
00:03:28.223 --> 00:03:31.650
or pull the URL from an environmental variable.

69
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.920
I'm not gonna fix that right now,

70
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.290
but that's really the only issue that we have.

71
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.230
Everything else seems to be working.

72
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.660
Just find, I think the only downside is that,

73
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.870
there are no serverless functions being run

74
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.740
on your own current server, so if you wanted

75
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.540
to get that to work, then you'd have to deploy it

76
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.740
to some other serverless function host,

77
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.457
and that's a whole ordeal on it's own.

78
00:03:55.457 --> 00:03:57.900
So, that really depends if you're using serverless functions

79
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.100
for your website or not.

80
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.130
If you're not, you can host it pretty much anywhere.

81
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.700
If you want, if you are, I would recommend sticking

82
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.630
with Netlify because Netlify just takes care

83
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.520
of all of that for you, which is pretty cool.

84
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.850
So that is hosting it off on your own.

85
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.053
See you in the next video.
