00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:02.898
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.160
<v Instructor>All right, let's work on some styles</v>

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.253
for laying all this out.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.330
This file is already getting pretty big,

5
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.840
it's almost 100 lines of code.

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.120
So, I'm going to keep the styles for this

7
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.300
in a separate file.

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.943
So, we'll go into our Styles folder,

9
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.643
and make a new OrderStyles.js.

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.483
I'll say Const OrderStyles = style.div,

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.423
and we need to import styled.

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.083
From...

13
00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:40.070
Oh, that was a weird one!

14
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.633
It used required.

15
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.813
Let's try it again.

16
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.913
Auto import.

17
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.560
Why is it using, doing require all of a sudden?

18
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.740
We'll just say import styled

19
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.323
from styled-components.

20
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.587
And then, in here, we have our OrderStyles,

21
00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:05.453
and then we'll say, export default OrderStyles.

22
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.823
I'll go, jump back into our order.

23
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.580
And oh, it's not a div, it's gonna be a form tag.

24
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.723
So, styled.form,

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.660
and then we'll go into where we have our form tag

26
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.223
of order.js page, and we'll say OrderStyles.

27
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.200
And must make sure that closing tag also worked.

28
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.173
No, it didn't!

29
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.913
And then let's also import OrderStyles,

30
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.653
and there we go, it's imported, cool!

31
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.480
Now, we'll go into our OrderStyles,

32
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.190
and we'll start writing all the code.

33
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.870
Again, you can grab this and skip this

34
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.300
if you don't feel like writing the CSS,

35
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.030
you can grab it from the finished file.

36
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.073
So, we'll say, display: grid;

37
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.327
grid-template-columns; 1fr 1fr;

38
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.470
gap: 20px; Cool!

39
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.713
I'll say, fieldset

40
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.723
is grid-column: span 2;

41
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.360
So what that does, is we made two columns,

42
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.460
but then we make every single fieldset,

43
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.383
span both of them so they go 100% wide.

44
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.230
We'll give it a max-height of 600px

45
00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:36.360
and that will just allow for scrolling

46
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.470
when there's more pizzas than we want to display.

47
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.550
So, we'll say overflow: auto;

48
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.370
display: grid; on that.

49
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.623
Gap: 1rem;

50
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.263
and align-content: start;

51
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.270
Okay, it's starting to look good.

52
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.610
Then we want the menu in the order

53
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.730
to be displayed side by side.

54
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.770
So what we'll do here, is we'll go on

55
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.313
to the fieldset for menu and give it a class of menu.

56
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.980
And we'll go on to the fieldset for our order,

57
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.973
give it a class of order.

58
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.433
We'll go in here, and we'll say,

59
00:03:18.433 --> 00:03:20.010
&amp; when it has a class of order,

60
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.680
or when it has a class of menu,

61
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.720
we'll say grid-column: span 1;

62
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.560
So we'll overwrite that. There we go!

63
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.563
And now, they're going side by side.

64
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.570
Then, finally, at the end here,

65
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.620
we'll just say @media (max-width: 900px),

66
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.870
so when it's 900 pixels,

67
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.700
we'll just say, fieldset.menu

68
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.620
and fieldset.order.

69
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.223
So, grid-column:

70
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.683
span 2;

71
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.230
So that actually...

72
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.063
There we go.

73
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.070
Let's leave this off for now

74
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.270
just 'cause the way that I have my recording setup,

75
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.140
is I wanna be able to see them side by side.

76
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.680
So let's comment that out just for now,

77
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.580
you don't have to, if you can see it just fine.

78
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.570
Okay, so, that's the OrderStyles.

79
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.570
Then we also need to style each of these pizzas right here.

80
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.090
So we'll go into our styles directory,

81
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.630
and I'll make a new file,

82
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.163
and I'll call that MenuItemStyles.js.

83
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.380
And we'll just go ahead and grab the import styled,

84
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.623
and I'll say, const MenuItemStyles = styled.div,

85
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.673
and then export default MenuItemStyles;

86
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.173
And here, we'll also display: grid;

87
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.330
grid-template-columns.

88
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.200
We want them to just show like,

89
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.570
we want 100 pixel image,

90
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.190
and then we want everything else to go to the right of it,

91
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.700
regardless of how much space there is.

92
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.370
So I'll say grid-template-columns: 100px, 1fr;

93
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.040
And let's pause there and swap this in,

94
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.440
so that we can see how changes happening in real time.

95
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.373
So, go back to your Order,

96
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.730
and here we go, where we loop over each of our pizzas.

97
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.700
We wanna replace this div here

98
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.473
with MenuItemStyles.

99
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.160
And I believe that is this one too!

100
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.913
And then we need to auto import that sucker.

101
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.923
Oh, that one didn't work!

102
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.603
No, it's not importing.

103
00:05:45.296 --> 00:05:47.080
All right, we'll just duplicate it,

104
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.357
and then say, MenuItemStyles.

105
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:51.324
Or you know what?

106
00:05:51.324 --> 00:05:53.030
Maybe 'cause to be exported... Yeah, we did!

107
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.033
Okay, that's cool.

108
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.600
All right, back to MenuItemStyles,

109
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.840
we've got a grid-template-columns,

110
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.210
you see what's going on here,

111
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.310
the image is gonna be 100 pixels,

112
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.020
and then the rest of the space is dedicated to what we want.

113
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.110
And then we say, grid-template-rows:

114
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.113
also make two rows, 1fr, 1fr each,

115
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.900
say grid-gap or just gap:

116
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.900
We can do 0 1.3rem; that's just 'cause I know(laughs)

117
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.370
how much I want, about 13 pixels of space between the two,

118
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.973
then we'll say, align-content: center;

119
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.253
align-items: center;

120
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.263
Okay, okay, okay!

121
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.560
Then we want, we want these buttons here...

122
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.680
Let me show you what I'm looking at.

123
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.000
We want it to look like this, right?

124
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.540
So we want the image to go

125
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.490
the full height or cover both rows.

126
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.200
So what we'll do is we'll select that image

127
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.010
and we'll say, you take up two rows.

128
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.980
So, I'll say, grid...

129
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.060
Oh, no, we gotta select it,

130
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.540
and the way that we select the images,

131
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.193
gatsby-image-wrapper.

132
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.623
We'll say, grid-row: span 2;

133
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.093
Boom! And then we'll also give it a height of 100%.

134
00:07:19.268 --> 00:07:20.600
And you see what that does,

135
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.150
is regardless of how high this menu item is,

136
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.273
the image will stretch itself.

137
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.940
And it's using, Gatsby image uses

138
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.700
object fit cover,

139
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.690
so that's why it's not being distorted,

140
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.040
it's just being cropped, which is what we want.

141
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.530
Now, some additional styles,

142
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.263
grab that paragraph and just put a margin: 0; on it.

143
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.960
We'll grab our button,

144
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.693
give it a font size of 1.5rem,

145
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.440
and then, we want some spacing between all of the buttons.

146
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.780
So we'll say, when there is a button

147
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.833
that comes next to a button, margin-left: 1rem;

148
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.283
is... Ooh!

149
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.160
See how it animated it? That's really cool.

150
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.993
Woo! Woo!

151
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.732
I like it!

152
00:08:20.732 --> 00:08:21.970
Alternatively, you could also wrap

153
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.283
all those buttons in a div, and put some grid gap on that.

154
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.150
And then, finally, we need a .remove,

155
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.750
or a button.rem...

156
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.283
Let's just type .remove.

157
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.770
I'll say, background: none

158
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.700
color: var(--red); I'll explain this.

159
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.370
This is when you wanna remove something from your order,

160
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.570
we'll be using these styles in here as well.

161
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.713
Font-Size: 3rem;

162
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.593
position: absolute;

163
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.873
top: 0; uh, that one, top: 0;

164
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.343
right: 0;

165
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.490
box-shadow: none;

166
00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.023
line-height: 1rem;

167
00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:17.500
All right, that doesn't do anything

168
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.670
'cause we don't have our remove button just yet.

169
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.870
Okay, so that's looking pretty good!

170
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.420
Don't worry about this,

171
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.480
this will never wrap around like this

172
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.220
because we will be using

173
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.190
that CSS that we did right here, in order to...

174
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.023
Here, let me show you?

175
00:09:34.023 --> 00:09:36.760
If we put that back on, that's how it's gonna look.

176
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.610
So, I'm just leaving it on

177
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.770
for now, so that we can see the menu items

178
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.340
in the order items.

179
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.420
All right, so we've got our info, our name, our email.

180
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.750
Now, when somebody clicks one of these buttons,

181
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.330
we need to add that item to our order.

182
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.160
And we're gonna create a custom hook

183
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.240
with custom state

184
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.690
in order to manage all of that in the next video.
