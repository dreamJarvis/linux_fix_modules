1
00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:02.599
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.243
<v Instructor>Alright, now we gotta work</v>

3
00:00:05.243 --> 00:00:07.950
on the individual SliceMasters pages

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.400
and this is something you should be able

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.460
to do on your own right now.

6
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.320
So I'm gonna invite you to try to,

7
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.900
when you click on one of these slice masters make this page,

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.960
do all the querying,

9
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.480
all the looping, all of that good stuff and then like

10
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.460
if you got it you can skip this video,

11
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.280
if you'd like to see how I come up on it,

12
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.550
then let's get going.

13
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.950
So, what do we need to do?

14
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.530
Well, we need to make a component

15
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.150
that is a template for this page

16
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.190
because we're not gonna manually make each single page,

17
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.676
we are going to be creating...

18
00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:44.270
It'd be kind of cool and this is what Next.js does

19
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.930
is if we had like a pages directory,

20
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.990
a source, pages and like,

21
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.200
we had like a folder called slicemaster

22
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.320
and then we had just like a star dot JS or person dot JS,

23
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.340
and it automatically pick that up for us,

24
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.410
that would be really neat,

25
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.120
like a kind of file based routing,

26
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.440
but Gatsby doesn't have that, at least not yet,

27
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.730
I'm not sure if they're planning on that.

28
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.970
So what we need to do is go into our Gatsby node,

29
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.940
clear all the data, loop over them, create the page,

30
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.830
which is very much like we've done with the rest of it.

31
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.770
So you can actually sort of like piggyback

32
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.000
on our function right here, turn slicemasters into pages,

33
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
because we have already queried all the slice masters,

34
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.760
and we've already looped over them.

35
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.210
So we can actually go in here

36
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.070
where we wrote this little To Do,

37
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.400
turn each slice master into their own page.

38
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.090
So that's what we will do right now.

39
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.600
Well what do we got here?

40
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.220
Data dot, what do we call that?

41
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.893
Slicemasters, slice masters.forEach slice master.

42
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.040
And we'll go in here, say actions.create,

43
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.450
what was I creating?

44
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.360
Node createPage.

45
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.490
Remember we did that right here.

46
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.000
So createPage.

47
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.363
And the template will be,

48
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.080
we will resolve the...

49
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.010
Actually we have to create it first, so hold on a sec here.

50
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.460
Let's go into our templates directory,

51
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.770
and let's actually just open up Pizza.js

52
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.610
and just save a copy of Pizza.js

53
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.800
and make it Slicemaster capital S

54
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.950
singular Slicemaster.js

55
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.993
And then let's just take out the Pizza Grid,

56
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.143
let's take that out,

57
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.460
let's sorry, let's just take everything out here,

58
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.023
let's just do a paragraph hey,

59
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.610
then we'll rename the Single Pizza Page

60
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.610
to slicemaster Page

61
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.697
and destructure the slicemaster.

62
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.210
Yeah slicemaster and then

63
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.033
let's take this query,

64
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.083 line:15% 
out for now.

65
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.053 line:15% 
Okay and then we'll go back to our Gatsby Node and resolve.

66
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.907
We need to go into the source, template, Slicemaster.js.

67
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.160
Oh, that shouldn't be template,

68
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.680
that should be component, sorry, component.

69
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.530
Other things we need to do is pass it a path,

70
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.760
so it's gonna be /slicemaster/

71
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.820
make this backtick so we can interpolate the slug

72
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.653
of the person

73
00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:50.253
slicemaster.slug.current.

74
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.440
And then we also wanna pass some context to that,

75
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.030
or the name of the person is the slicemaster.person,

76
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.673
and the slug is the slicemaster.slug.current.

77
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.223
Alright, let's go ahead and kill our process here.

78
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.083
Restart it.

79
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.820
And let's just see if these pages are being created for us,

80
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.020
or if we get any errors that we need to fix.

81
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.943
Oh, a bit of an error popped up here.

82
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.910
Oh, data.slicemasters.forEach is not a function, okay?

83
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.083
So that means this is wrong.

84
00:04:41.354 --> 00:04:44.880
Slicemasters.nodes,I always do that, always do it.

85
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.260
Alright, we'll kill it,

86
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.383
start it again.

87
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:51.780
There we go it's up and running,

88
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.963
now, if I refresh,

89
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.150
we do get a page,

90
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.373
we get an error here, cannot access property, oh yeah.

91
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.950
Slice masters cause we're trying

92
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.700
to destructure slice master here

93
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.590
when we haven't...

94
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.500
We don't have a query.

95
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.200
So let's just take that whole thing out, Save it,

96
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.880
there we go.

97
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.140
Okay, so if we go to any slicemaster now,

98
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.680
we should see a page that's been created

99
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.680
and if we go to a page that doesn't exist, we should see,

100
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.920
we have pages for every single slicemaster, okay?

101
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.770
So next up,

102
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.933
we need to create a query for that specific person.

103
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.563
So we will export const query is equal to graphql.

104
00:05:43.107 --> 00:05:47.700
And then in here we will query and we expect somebody

105
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.300
to pass us the slug

106
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.510
and of course our context will be passing us the slug

107
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.470
and we'll use that slug to query the specific person

108
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.893
for that, so there'll be a String that is required,

109
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.160
then we'll ask for a person which is really sanityPerson,

110
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.320
where the slug.current is equal to the slug value,

111
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.480
slug variable that was passed in.

112
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.083
Alright, then for each person, you know note their name,

113
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.613
note their ID,

114
00:06:29.613 --> 00:06:32.450
note their description,

115
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.570
and we want their image, which has an asset,

116
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.500
which has a fluid.

117
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.510
And we're going to give ourselves a big picture

118
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.580
of the slice master.

119
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.030
So a thousand pixels

120
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.883
and max height of 750 PX.

121
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.020
And then we want ...GatsbySanityImageFluid.

122
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.070
Alright, let's go to one of our slice masters pages,

123
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.570
let's go to Slick himself

124
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.720
and then we will destructure data

125
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.270
and let's just console.logdata,

126
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.883
data.person, here we go, there's Slick himself.

127
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.310
So we can, destructure this a little bit further,

128
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.020
we could destructure the person like that

129
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.920
and then console.log the person, here we go.

130
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.750
We're seeing it, okay, cool,

131
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.750
now what I need to do is just return a div...

132
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.520
I'm gonna just give it a div of the class of center.

133
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.480
And then in that we need Gatsby image

134
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.480
or a person fluid is equal to person.image.asset.fluid,

135
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.230
let's see if an image shows up,

136
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.373
there he is and loads,

137
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.690
underneath that we'll have the h2

138
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.770
span with a class of mark on it.

139
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.003
And then inside of that, we say person.name,

140
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.160
that's working on the file underneath

141
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.363
that paragraph tag, person.description.

142
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.860
Beautiful, I don't need any more CSS added to that,

143
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.730
so actually we can get rid of this importing

144
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.240
of styled components

145
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.600
and that is our single slicemaster page.

146
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.433
Good job.
