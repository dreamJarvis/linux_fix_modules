1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.583
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.650
<v Instructor>Hi, what we wanna do here</v>

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.500
is just kind of go through the website

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.620
and Paula shop, any loose corners, things like that,

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.250
as well as loose...

6
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.190
are loose corners polished?

7
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.280
You know what I mean.

8
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.300
And as well as like make sure that the whole thing

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.840
is nicely responsive.

10
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.000
So just looking at the homepage here,

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.100
and I'm noticing this copyrights Slicks Slices 2020.

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.240
That should be centered.

13
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.077
So let's go to our layout and,

14
00:00:30.077 --> 00:00:31.623
no, that's in our footer,

15
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.053
and we'll just give it a class of center.

16
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.640
Boom, that one's fixed, okay?

17
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.910
Next I want to work on the responsiveness.

18
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.490
Oh, and actually let's,

19
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.490
let's tackle all these like react issues right here.

20
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.730
So, should have a unique key prop unloading grid.

21
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.563
Let's look that up.

22
00:00:51.563 --> 00:00:52.513
Loading grid,

23
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.613
here we go.

24
00:00:54.613 --> 00:00:57.043
So let's say key is equal to,

25
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.290
we'll call it a loader

26
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.450
cause I'm tempted just to put i,

27
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.920
but then if something else on the page has that

28
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.350
so we'll call it loader dash,

29
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.163
we'll integrate the number in there.

30
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.823
Okay, now we've got the same thing in item grid.

31
00:01:24.295 --> 00:01:25.128
All right go,

32
00:01:25.128 --> 00:01:26.780
we'll say key is equal to,

33
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.380
I believe the item has an ID in this case

34
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.713
so we can just use that.

35
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.170
Boom, I don't think so actually,

36
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.343
so I'm gonna check.

37
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.473
Console dot log items.

38
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.743
Oh, it's underscore id, okay.

39
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.663
So add an underscore there,

40
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.473
get rid of that console log.

41
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.850
Get rid of this fetching data too.

42
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.333
Sometimes I leave stuff in,

43
00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.430
there we go,

44
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.140
get rid of that.

45
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.123
These image cropped are truncated.

46
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.103
It's not, looks fine.

47
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.380
I don't know what that,

48
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.520
I ignore that error.

49
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.210
Of course these errors always show up in Firefox

50
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.460
for whatever reason there's nothing to worry about.

51
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.293
That's looking good.

52
00:02:24.293 --> 00:02:26.470
Let's just click through the rest of the pages.

53
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.530
Make sure anything, there we go.

54
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.973
Let's open up the toppings filter clear out that.

55
00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.383
So here we go, boom, boom.

56
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.873
And toppings filter line 80.

57
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.360
Looks good.

58
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.950
Go to a specific topping slice masters,

59
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.550
oh, here's another slice masters

60
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.920
has got these key errors all over the place.

61
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.793
So we'll go to slice masters,

62
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.040
and we'll look for a map,

63
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.873
there we go.

64
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.113
Key is equal to person dot underscore id.

65
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.840
Oh no, in this case it's just id.

66
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.260
So you see that the issue we just had there

67
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.610
is that in Gatsby it's just dot id,

68
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.720
but when you're getting the data straight from Sanity

69
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.410
it's underscore id.

70
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.403
And then the same thing is happening in pagination.

71
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.633
Look for map,

72
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.873
there we go.

73
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.747
Key is equal to,

74
00:03:36.747 --> 00:03:39.170
and we'll just make up a key page

75
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.313
and we'll use the index to make it unique.

76
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.453
Beautiful, and then order ahead,

77
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.180
looking good.

78
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.520
All right, so that's fixed.

79
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.650
Next is let's go mobile and start making sure,

80
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.040
I think the first thing that needs

81
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.090
to be dealt with is this nav,

82
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.090
at a certain time slice masters overrides the logo.

83
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.423
Yeah, so around,

84
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.440
let's fix this first.

85
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.733
I was like, why is that not centered, right?

86
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.263
So let's take a look here.

87
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.913
This list item,

88
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.530
if we put a text line center on there

89
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.880
and then display block,

90
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.043
ooh, there we go.

91
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.020
That's what we want,

92
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.733
if we do even need that, no.

93
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.800
Okay, so that's what we want.

94
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.143
Let's go into our nav and find the nav styles,

95
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.490
Ul, li, a,

96
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.607
put a display block on there

97
00:04:58.607 --> 00:05:01.740
and that will, it fill up the entire grid item

98
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.860
or flex item grid item.

99
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.120
Oh, that's a bit weird.

100
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.353
You go bigger and smaller slice masters runs into it,

101
00:05:11.841 --> 00:05:13.823
and then resize, it's fine.

102
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.370
Something funky is going on

103
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.663
with this logo.

104
00:05:24.482 --> 00:05:26.432
And is it because of reason that clamp,

105
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.710
let's look it up.

106
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.710
Logo, what that, font size,

107
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.423
let's see.

108
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.253
Oh, that's way too big.

109
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.660
Oh yeah, this was supposed to be in pixels,

110
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.423
six px.

111
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.117
I did read about some issues with clamp

112
00:06:06.117 --> 00:06:09.740
and I actually even logged a bug with Safari and clamp.

113
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.453
I wonder if those issues live in Firefox as well.

114
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.940
Yes yeah, fresh,

115
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.090
it looks better.

116
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.793
Let's check it out in Safari.

117
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.770
Let's bring back that weird clamp,

118
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.060
let's see if the issue is in Safari as well.

119
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.173
Smaller,

120
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.570
no, it's only in Firefox.

121
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.853
So the issue was when I went smaller,

122
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.900
yeah, weird issue with clamp.

123
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.700
All right, I guess I can't use that.

124
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.673
I'm just gonna stick with six px,

125
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.993
or maybe even six vw.

126
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.713
Whoa, 0.3 vws?

127
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.750
That's looking a little bit better.

128
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.763
I bet 0.6 would look better.

129
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.793
Now is that,

130
00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:35.623
yes, still the same issue.

131
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.810
All right, we're going back just to pixels.

132
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.100
I'm sure some of you will figure it out

133
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.120
and send me a pull request on GitHub

134
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.180
and we can add it in,

135
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.900
but I'm not gonna goof around with that too much.

136
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.950
Right, let's let's look at this nav now.

137
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.610
So as it gets smaller,

138
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.883
so at about 800px,

139
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.700
we need to make the font size smaller.

140
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.370
So we'll go to,

141
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.203
what's this?

142
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.323
Font size,

143
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.670
let's go back to our nav.

144
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.670
Oh, let's find that a and we'll say at media.

145
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.660
So the cool thing about stock components

146
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.310
is you can put your media queries right inside

147
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.290
of your selector.

148
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.060
So at media,

149
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.000
max width, 800px

150
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.633
say font size at 1.5rem.

151
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.693
Here we go.

152
00:08:38.693 --> 00:08:41.930
Those are much smaller when we hit that break point,

153
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.140
maybe a little bit too small.

154
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.053
Let's go two rem.

155
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.333
There we go,

156
00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:47.166
that's looking pretty good.

157
00:08:47.166 --> 00:08:49.311
And then at a certain point,

158
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:52.330
this things are getting way too small.

159
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.330
So what we need to do is to put this Slick's Slices up above

160
00:08:57.489 --> 00:09:01.600
and then put all these ones down below it.

161
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.920
So let's take a look at our, our nav here.

162
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.920
It's a grid with the columns of one, one, auto, one, one,

163
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.133
and at about 600px,

164
00:09:15.999 --> 00:09:17.360
we'll rejig that.

165
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.600
So we could stick a media query directly inside this ul,

166
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.760
or just go to the bottom and write a media query

167
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.800
that will still be scoped to the whole nav.

168
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.800
So say @ media, max width, 600 PX,

169
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.363
and we'll grab our unordered list,

170
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.830
and we're gonna make two rows.

171
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.480
So grid template rows,

172
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.160
and we'll just make them both auto auto.

173
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.460
And then the columns,

174
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.210
we need to make grid, template, columns.

175
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.830
We need to make it like four columns,

176
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.100
but I'm gonna make this,

177
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.660
we're gonna have to change it down to two columns,

178
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.540
even once more.

179
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.373
So what I'm gonna do

180
00:09:56.373 --> 00:09:58.533
is I'm gonna make a variable called columns.

181
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.830
And let's just say four.

182
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.830
And here we'll say repeat, var, dash dash columns, one fr.

183
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.500
Let's see what that's got, there we go.

184
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.333
So look at this,

185
00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:16.120
now we've got one, two, three, four columns.

186
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.790
And then because we did two rows,

187
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.770
the second one is spilling over.

188
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.553
Now we need to grab onto this logo item, this li.

189
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.420
And in order to do that we need to pop a class on it.

190
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.650
So that is this one,

191
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.913
class name of logo dash item.

192
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.823
Go here,

193
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.620
we'll say dot logo, item, background red,

194
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.080
see what we're working with here?

195
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.560
Boom, that's the one we want,

196
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.940
and we want to put it before everything.

197
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.283
So order zero.

198
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.160
Okay, so I'll put it before everything

199
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.440
and then we want it to take up the entire row,

200
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.217
so we'll say grid column is one,

201
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.053
start at one and go to the end, negative one.

202
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.000
Boom, okay?

203
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.710
And then we want to center it.

204
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:16.617
So I believe that's justify items center.

205
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.363
Boom, okay.

206
00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:23.120
So now we've got Slick Slices showing up there.

207
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.460
We'll also need to bring it down a little bit.

208
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:30.323
So we'll scrap the logo, say transform none.

209
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.930
That will bring it down to its original spot.

210
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.923
And we've got all our four items showing up down below here.

211
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.740
A little bit more,

212
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.923
we'll grab the nav and say margin bottom two rem,

213
00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:45.190
a little bit of space in between there.

214
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.080
You could also say border bottom one px solid grey.

215
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.360
I don't, I don't really like that.

216
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.363
Maybe padding bottom two rem.

217
00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.010
Yeah, that doesn't look too bad.

218
00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.393
Maybe two px.

219
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.960
All right, that looks pretty good.

220
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.670
And then finally, once it gets even more clamped.

221
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.670
So at, I don't know, maybe at 500px,

222
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.880
we'll put these on two dual line.

223
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.670
So we'll go down here,

224
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.003
say at media,

225
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.983
max width 500px,

226
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.870
and all we have to do in this case

227
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.670
is just change the number of columns.

228
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.013
So overwrite that variable just to two,

229
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.490
and boom, look at that.

230
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:34.410
And that's so cool.

231
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.300
I love CSS variables cause you're just composing

232
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.890
this variable into here.

233
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.287
But in our case,

234
00:12:41.287 --> 00:12:42.310
we don't have to select the ul

235
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.660
and then redo the columns.

236
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.510
Just change the variable,

237
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.410
and it will know enough to hop up there and show,

238
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.697
show that.

239
00:12:49.697 --> 00:12:52.209
So (mumbles),

240
00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:53.431
looking good.

241
00:12:53.431 --> 00:12:54.264
All right, let's do that.

242
00:12:54.264 --> 00:12:58.543
The next, next one is,

243
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.140
is, oh, look at this,

244
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.770
if you have a title

245
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.150
that is more than one line

246
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.480
like White After Labor Day,

247
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.860
the transform is all goofed up.

248
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.120
So let's go into that next.

249
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.113
So we'll go into believe the item grid,

250
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:20.870
oh, it's item styles,

251
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:21.763
let's go to that.

252
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.670
And it's positioned relative

253
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.000
and that's the paragraph right here.

254
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.190
So what I'm gonna do is I'll take off this transform

255
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.790
and see what we're working with.

256
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.623
Okay there.

257
00:13:34.487 --> 00:13:36.053
Let's say top zero.

258
00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.483
Okay, so my question is why if we absolute position this,

259
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.050
why is top zero not going to the top of the item style?

260
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.803
So let's inspect it and see why.

261
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.010
Oh, it's because that paragraph has margin on it.

262
00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.173
So margins zero.

263
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:00.853
Okay good.

264
00:14:00.853 --> 00:14:03.563
And then if we put back the rotate,

265
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.573
tick off the translate,

266
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.670
I believe if we transform,

267
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.350
translate Y not a percentage,

268
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.623
but a pixel value.

269
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.610
Yeah, like negative 20 pixels.

270
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.240
Not even 10, that looks good.

271
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.610
Now we anchor it from the top and go down,

272
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.700
so that that's looking pretty good.

273
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.730
Now let's deal with any responsive issues

274
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.500
that come up with this homepage grid.

275
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.830
So at a certain point,

276
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.073
let's call it 800 pixels,

277
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.690
it starts to look a little bit funky.

278
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.010
Hey says, this is another use case for sub grid.

279
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:46.843
I won't do it here

280
00:14:46.843 --> 00:14:50.360
but where this is taking up two lines

281
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.880
and this is taking one line,

282
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.730
but they're not in the same grid,

283
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.410
you could use subgrid to align them

284
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.963
based on the highest item.

285
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.240
So next we need to,

286
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.180
yeah, let's call it 800px.

287
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:10.180
So we'll go to our grid, homepage grid.

288
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.023
We have two of these columns right here.

289
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.510
And at a certain point we'll make it one column.

290
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:22.500
So what we can do here is say, var columns,

291
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.653
say we one or two,

292
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.933
and then put the columns in there,

293
00:15:34.924 --> 00:15:35.960
that doesn't do anything good.

294
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.653
And then we'll add media max with 800px,

295
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.633
columns, that's one.

296
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.043
Here we go.

297
00:15:47.043 --> 00:15:50.250
So at a certain point that shows up.

298
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.493
You probably could even,

299
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.700
do four beside each other,

300
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.680
no, cause this is essentially four as Walnut,

301
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.790
don't do four.

302
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.250
So boom, boom, boom.

303
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.770
And I'm asking now,

304
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.520
does it ever need to go down to one?

305
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.353
I don't think so.

306
00:16:05.353 --> 00:16:10.220
Like 320 is the smallest a phone will go.

307
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.750
Probably the only thing we need to do here

308
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.720
is make this text a little smaller.

309
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.110
So go to our item styles,

310
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:23.110
just say at media, maybe you can just do like font size,

311
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:32.533
two vw, five vw,

312
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.090
that's way too big, now it's not gonna work.

313
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.423
You could use clamp there.

314
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.180
Let's try it.

315
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.500
Clamp, clamp,

316
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.850
minimum 12px,

317
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.590
five vw and at a maximum 20px.

318
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.170
Yeah, that works out.

319
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.003
That's cool.

320
00:17:04.003 --> 00:17:06.200
So I love stuff like this where like,

321
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.010
you don't even need to have a media query,

322
00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.430
you just need to think ahead in terms of your font sizing.

323
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.280
And I would also say font size two rem

324
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.830
just for a fallback

325
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.760
for browsers that don't know what clamp is.

326
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.990
Just as a sort of a backup just in case.

327
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.070
So that's looking pretty good.

328
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:26.540
Let's go onto the next page here.

329
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.713
A pizza menu.

330
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:30.893
Let's go small.

331
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.343
All right, So what do we do,

332
00:17:34.343 --> 00:17:36.830
what do we do about,

333
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.650
okay, this is already, this is already working.

334
00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.500
So no worries there,

335
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.090
but like this is a bit much.

336
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.900
I think we just need to make the font size a bit smaller.

337
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.210
So we'll go to our toppings, filter,

338
00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:01.350
and, font size, font size,

339
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.330
let's try the clamp again.

340
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.330
I'm a big fan of the clamp.

341
00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.430
Unless it doesn't work then I don't like it.

342
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:11.430
A 1.5rem, one vw, Let's try that,

343
00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.200
and 2.5rem,

344
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.400
let's see how that does.

345
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.540
That makes it a bit smaller,

346
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.443
is it too big?

347
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.943
Let's try two vw.

348
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.420
That's too big, 1.54?

349
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.450
I hit four instead.

350
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.750
Now it looks good,

351
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.543
as it gets smaller as you go.

352
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.343
Oh, it's good.

353
00:18:36.343 --> 00:18:37.350
I like that.

354
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.370
And all the different pizzas are here.

355
00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.230
Click through to one of the pizzas.

356
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.820
That's looking good,

357
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.930
order ahead.

358
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.763
Oh yes, this needs some work.

359
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:51.020
All right, let's this is probably just grid, right?

360
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.960
Didn't we already do some of this.

361
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.433
So let's look at the order, touches.

362
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.773
Then we comment out some,

363
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.360
let's look at where's our order styles?

364
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.720
Here we go.

365
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.853
Click through to that.

366
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.780
Yeah, we already did this.

367
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.883
Look at this, boom.

368
00:19:15.207 --> 00:19:16.040
We go,

369
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.999
add some, add some, add some, add some,

370
00:19:19.999 --> 00:19:22.180
one thing maybe.

371
00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.530
I'm not sure if this would make sense or not is

372
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.140
put the order above it,

373
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.850
nah, no, that doesn't make sense,

374
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.860
this is good, I like this a lot.

375
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.280
It's looking good, Slice Masters.

376
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.713
How does our pagination look in mobile?

377
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.550
Oh, almost we almost got away with it.

378
00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.640
We almost got away with it,

379
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.830
our people look good.

380
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.800
Our people look good but our pagination does not.

381
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.330
So what can we do about this pagination?

382
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.643
At a certain point,

383
00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.240
maybe get word,

384
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.010
get rid of the word previous and next.

385
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.120
Let's look,

386
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.653
let's open up our pagination,

387
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.990
next, let's put out okay,

388
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:09.023
We're in a wrap,

389
00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:14.420
our previous and next rap with abbreviation

390
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.853
and we'll wrap it in a span of the class of word.

391
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:26.140
And what we'll need to do is to add titles to these

392
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.333
because if we hide the word previous and next,

393
00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:32.470
then we need to make them accessible.

394
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:36.830
So title should be previous page

395
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:43.220
and next page, okay?

396
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.583
Then we'll open our pagination styles.

397
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.530
Where's our pagination styles?

398
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.600
Oh, they're right here.

399
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.433
All right.

400
00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.920
And we'll say at

401
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.330
800px that's it.

402
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.343
So at media,

403
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.153
max with 800px,

404
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.770
word, is it word?

405
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.360
What do we wrap it in,

406
00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.563
span with the class of word,

407
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.293
display none.

408
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.323
Here we go, okay?

409
00:21:30.323 --> 00:21:32.323
Now it's smaller, smaller, smaller.

410
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.770
Can we get down to 320, can we do it?

411
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:38.890
We can't,

412
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:39.843
oh, wait, we can.

413
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.140
Little tight, little tight,

414
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.223
let's not do that.

415
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:52.160
800px font size, 1.4rem,

416
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.490
yeah, just make it a little bit smaller.

417
00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:58.890
We're a good shape, cool.

418
00:21:58.890 --> 00:21:59.963
So that's that?

419
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.360
I believe that is looking pretty good.

420
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.490
Yeah, I've got no horizontal scrolling

421
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.013
or anything to deal with.

422
00:22:11.013 --> 00:22:12.370
So, that is making it responsive

423
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.970
and all that one is a little bit more off the cuff

424
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.860
than necessarily normal,

425
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.100
but I thought I would sort of take care of it along

426
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.507
for the ride of just my process for saying,

427
00:22:21.507 --> 00:22:23.210
"all right, I got this thing done,

428
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.890
now how to make this good on mobile."

429
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.610
And it really isn't all that many media queries,

430
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.640
if you're smart about using grid and flexbox,

431
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.100
and now clamp I'm ahead of time.
