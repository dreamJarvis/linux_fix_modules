00:00:00.181 --> 00:00:03.181
<v ->(xylophone music)</v>

2
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:06.760
<v ->It's masters.</v>

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.250
Now I think this one will probably be two videos.

4
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.970
The first one with query of the data we loop over it.

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.608
We display it.

6
00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:15.010
You should be able to do that part by-on your own

7
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.610
by now. 'Cause we've done that,

8
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.030
I don't know, 7,000 times already.

9
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.800
But the next part is going to be a little bit interesting.

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.810
I show you how to paginate data.

11
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.930
So like instead of having everything on one page,

12
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.020
I'm gonna show you how to have a little

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.630
next page, previous page, little numbers

14
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.590
of pages on it.

15
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.380
And when you click it, you can go through it.

16
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.071
So let's jump into that now.

17
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.680
We'll go to our pages and we'll

18
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.510
open up slice master dot JS.

19
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.670
This nav is not necessary here now.

20
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.040
Now, like what do we need to do?

21
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.940
Well, we need to clear the data.

22
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.320
We need to go ahead and loop over the data and then we need

23
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.392
to display it and then we'll pick it up and come back and

24
00:00:55.392 --> 00:00:58.370
modify that. So we can do page one, page two, page three,

25
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.030
et cetera, et cetera.

26
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.730
So let's export a default,

27
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.283
no export constant query is equal to graph QL.

28
00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:13.733
And in that you will have a query where we, um

29
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.060
what, what did we call this? Slice masters.

30
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.060
Let's go to our Gatsby graph, QL end point.

31
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.420
Let's look at our Explorer here.

32
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.610
Um, all sanity person. Okay.

33
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.800
So it's not called slice.

34
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.900
I just call it slice masters in the backend.

35
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.340
But if you were to take a look at our actual schema,

36
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.980
uh, if we open up person dot JS,

37
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.930
you'll see the actual name of this type is person and the

38
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.820
title. What it's visible is slice masters.

39
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.920
So we'll go here.

40
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.920
We'll say all sanity person and we'll rename that

41
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.180
to slice masters.

42
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.740
And for each person we want.

43
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.790
Now here's interesting.

44
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.393
We were going to need to know how many people there are

45
00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:09.140
in order to do all of our pagination.

46
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.580
So in order to get that we can query the total count.

47
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.600
And that will tell us how many people there are.

48
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.580
Because, um, when we come back and do pagination here,

49
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.052
we're not going to be crewing them all at once.

50
00:02:20.052 --> 00:02:22.650
And therefore we won't be able to tell how many there are,

51
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.193
unless you ask graph QL for it. So here actually,

52
00:02:25.193 --> 00:02:28.600
let me show you this, paste that in here, run it.

53
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.812
You'll see. It tells us there is 10 total people.

54
00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:35.692
And that is right. If you look into our back end here,

55
00:02:35.692 --> 00:02:36.793
there's 10 right here. Okay?

56
00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:43.262
Next up we need each person. So nodes and you see name,

57
00:02:44.524 --> 00:02:46.713
Uh, next up uh, we need each person, so notes

58
00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:49.873
and name. You see now why we have this nodes thing,

59
00:02:49.873 --> 00:02:51.553
because you can also query meta-metadata about that query,

60
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:53.384
like such as the total count.

61
00:02:53.384 --> 00:02:56.002
So we want the name of the person, the idea of the person,

62
00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:59.193
the slug, the current slug of the person

63
00:02:59.193 --> 00:03:02.890
we want the description of the person.

64
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.883
Uh, we want their image.

65
00:03:06.743 --> 00:03:08.330
And then the asset.

66
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.700
We want a fluid image of the person that max width is going

67
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.130
to be a 410 PX.

68
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.710
Um I'm not sure why I put the 10 PX on there,

69
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.460
but just live your life.

70
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.460
And then we get the data dot Gatsby, sanity image fluid.

71
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.090
Um, then we should be able to go up here, de-structure

72
00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:36.244
that data. See const slice masters. Uh, slice masters

73
00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:45.707
equal to data dot slice masters dot um, no notes.

74
00:03:49.797 --> 00:03:54.797
And let's just do quick little console log the nodes and

75
00:03:57.816 --> 00:03:59.863
check over. Oh, this is needs to be auto imported.

76
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.390
Boom import graph QL from Gatsby. Alright, let's

77
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.390
go back to this page here. We need to work on this.

78
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.780
On this responsive nav here so don't worry too much

79
00:04:13.947 --> 00:04:15.206
about that. There we go.

80
00:04:15.206 --> 00:04:17.220
There's our array of all of our 10 people and it's now being

81
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.053
rendered out.

82
00:04:18.053 --> 00:04:22.250
So let's get into uh, creating a grid of the people here.

83
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.420
So get rid of this,

84
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.750
give ourselves a div uh, we'll loop over each of these

85
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.486
slice masters. So slice masters dot map,

86
00:04:31.486 --> 00:04:34.360
and we will call a singular one.

87
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.177
Let's just call it person from each. We want to um-I

88
00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:40.260
want the, I want parentheses.

89
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.450
I'm going to do the implicit return here.

90
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.030
So for each person will have a diff and then we'll have a

91
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.013
link to individual slice master.

92
00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:58.966
Slice, master Forward slash person dot slug dot current.

93
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.393
And then inside of that link, one H two tag,

94
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.940
give ourselves a span of the class of mark

95
00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:14.363
and we'll put their name in there, person name.

96
00:05:15.417 --> 00:05:17.163
Okay. Let's let's save that so far.

97
00:05:18.358 --> 00:05:19.500
A link will not work. Why?

98
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.778
Because we have not imported link from Gatsby.

99
00:05:23.778 --> 00:05:25.163
So import link from Gatsby.

100
00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.356
There we go. There's all the people.

101
00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:29.189
Okay, good.

102
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.410
Then below that link, we want an image.

103
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.880
So let's import IMG from Gatsby image

104
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.490
here capital IMG.

105
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.808
And then we pass it the fluid,

106
00:05:44.808 --> 00:05:49.808
which is person dot image dot asset,

107
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.913
which is person dot image dot asset dot fluid.

108
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.540
Looks like these folks are showing up there, Slick himself.

109
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.540
Okay.

110
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.450
Um. then below,

111
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.430
I'm going to paragraph with the class of description

112
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.173
and inside of that person dot description.

113
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.910
And does that person show up?

114
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:24.993
There we go.

115
00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.438
You have all of the things. Okay.

116
00:06:28.438 --> 00:06:29.310
So that's our basic rendering.

117
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.310
Um, let's work on some quick CSS to get it rendered out.

118
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.130
Uh-we need two different style components here,

119
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.910
one for the actual grid of people,

120
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.500
and then the second for the actual individual person.

121
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.253
So let's work on the grid first.

122
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.610
We'll call it Const slice master grid

123
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.160
is equal to style that div

124
00:06:54.075 --> 00:06:59.075
got import styled. Good. We'll display grid,

125
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.440
grid gap to REM.

126
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.230
We're doing this a lot in this website.

127
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.540
So it might even make sense to make some sort of reasonable

128
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.920
grid component where maybe you could pass in like a CSS

129
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.753
variable or,

130
00:07:14.753 --> 00:07:18.540
or just use a CSS variable that overwrites the number of

131
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.733
columns that you want.

132
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.173
So grid, template, columns.

133
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.760
Ooh, look at that little shortcut.

134
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.697
G T C, and then I'm hitting my Emmett expansion.

135
00:07:29.697 --> 00:07:32.467
We're going to repeat auto fill.

136
00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:37.467
Min-max 250 PX in one F R. Boom.

137
00:07:40.366 --> 00:07:42.017
Gotta use the grid now.

138
00:07:42.017 --> 00:07:44.830
So go and replace this div here with a slice master grid.

139
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.760
And you might be saying like West, why are you still,

140
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.980
why are you still using these?

141
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.760
And that's because we're gonna put our pagination right

142
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.253
above this. So keep these here.

143
00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.990
Alright, here we go.

144
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.990
Look at that is looking pretty good.

145
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.840
Now let's go and do the styling of the

146
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.114
individual slice master.

147
00:08:07.114 --> 00:08:09.270
Cause you can see like look at this.

148
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.290
Some of these images are really tall and some

149
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.263
of them are not.

150
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.420
So say const slice master styles SQL to

151
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.343
style dot div.

152
00:08:28.015 --> 00:08:30.533
And it will say, Hey, text decoration, none.

153
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.130
We'll grab the image.

154
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.490
Now this is a little weird thing with Gatsby images.

155
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.413
If you want to grab the image,

156
00:08:37.413 --> 00:08:40.350
you don't just select the IMG because it's wrapped in a div

157
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.950
and has all that extra stuff.

158
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.990
You grab the dot Gatsby image wrapper.

159
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.540
That's the class that Gatsby puts on that.

160
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.460
And we'll just say, we'll give it a height of 400 PX

161
00:08:56.386 --> 00:08:58.461
and um, that didn't work. Okay.

162
00:08:58.461 --> 00:09:00.336
Let me let's. Let's do Oh, why didn't it work?

163
00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:04.743
Cause I didn't use it. I do this every single time.

164
00:09:04.743 --> 00:09:08.860
I forgot to actually put the slice master styles in sort of

165
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.010
replaced that div where the actual slice master house.

166
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.890
There we go. Now this is so cool.

167
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.890
So remember when we used um, sanity and we said,

168
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.080
the image hotspot is equal to true.

169
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.550
Um now, if we have any of these P-these

170
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.444
are actually looking all

171
00:09:28.444 --> 00:09:29.372
pretty good.

172
00:09:29.372 --> 00:09:31.260
But if we had an image where somebody was not in the center

173
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.680
of the image and it was cropped, it wasn't

174
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.180
cropped well, what you can do is you can go and edit that.

175
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.970
Let's do Roscoe, you edit the image

176
00:09:48.351 --> 00:09:49.620
and you'll see, we can,

177
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.480
you can put the little circle right around poor little

178
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.793
Roscoe's face.

179
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.810
And you see for all the different sizes of image,

180
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.600
the face is always in there.

181
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.750
So if you ever do have an image, that's being cropped weird,

182
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.820
especially like if like a phone or product or something is

183
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.610
off to the side, you can always hotspot it.

184
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:15.330
And then that way, when it decides how to crop the image,

185
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.930
it will make sure that that hotspot is always visible

186
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.893
inside of the crop, which is awesome.

187
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.523
Let's go back to our Gatsby front end here,

188
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.470
and we'll go back up here. Let's grab that.

189
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.210
H two tag, that's their name.

190
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.330
That little yellow that they have there.

191
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:40.330
Transform, rotate two degrees, negative two degrees,

192
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:49.270
text line line center, font size four REM margin,

193
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.740
bottom negative two REM position relative

194
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.243
and Z index two.

195
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.460
Ooh, look at that.

196
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.620
So it's just kinda, Oh,

197
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.340
it looks a little bit nicer to pop it right over top of it

198
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.749
and all that little short cutting that I just did.

199
00:11:10.749 --> 00:11:12.950
That is Emmett in CSS.

200
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.360
And that's how I write almost all of my CSS. I never,

201
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.709
not never,

202
00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:20.180
but a lot of the times I won't write the entire thing.

203
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.180
I'll just write the Emmett abbreviation and hit my expansion

204
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.760
key and it'll just go all the full way.

205
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.230
And that in that case, it worked for every single one,

206
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.973
which is really cool.

207
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.840
Next, we want to take the description and we'll put a,

208
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.933
a yellow background on it.

209
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.500
Our yellow

210
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.980
that's looking pretty good padding,

211
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.980
one REM margin to REM margin, top negative six REM.

212
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.660
And that should bump it up. Okay.

213
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.550
I think we need a Z index of two to pop it over top of the

214
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:07.550
image and the index is ignored unless you have a position of

215
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.640
absolute or relative, I think.

216
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:13.990
Yeah.

217
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.067
And then we will transform, rotate a one degree.

218
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.513
Beautiful.

219
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.530
Oh, I like it. I like it. I like it.

220
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.140
Maybe text line center on that. Does that,

221
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.140
will that look good?

222
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.723
Yeah, I like it.

223
00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:40.420
Cool. So that is our slice masters.

224
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.490
Let's just make sure it's still somewhat responsive.

225
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.440
It is beautiful.

226
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.890
You see how the Roscoe let's watch how Roscoe's face-

227
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.603
no matter the size is always inside of it.

228
00:12:51.603 --> 00:12:56.413
Alright, so that is getting the slice masters to show up.

229
00:12:56.413 --> 00:13:01.413
But what if I only wanted to show two pieces of content per

230
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.741
page? So in the next video,

231
00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:06.063
I'm gonna show you how we can start to implement pagination.
