00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.583
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:05.920
<v Narrator>All right, In this video we're gonna talk about</v>

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.540
making reusable layouts in Gatsby.

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.720
And this is pretty handy because most likely

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.500
you're gonna want a general structure,

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.340
a header, a footer, a nav.

7
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.070
Something that is on either all pages or most pages.

8
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.070
I'm gonna show you how to do both.

9
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.560
So let's go into our components folder here

10
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.940
and let's make a new file

11
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.240
and call it capital L Layout.js.

12
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.240
And Gatsby doesn't have any special layout system in it.

13
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.270
So there's no special layout thing in Gatsby.

14
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.490
Simply you are just using react components

15
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.420
with children components inside of it.

16
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.890
So let's do our whole import react from react

17
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.860
and then we will export default function, capital L layout.

18
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.590
And then from that let's return a div

19
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.320
and inside of that let's give ourselves a...

20
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.833
let's just start with the nav.

21
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.780
Nav and then just P-I-M, the page content.

22
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.810
Oh, one thing we didn't do here is...

23
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.680
you'll see this underlined here, nav is not defined.

24
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.320
We did not import that.

25
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.420
So we can either go into here and import the nav

26
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.480
or one thing I really like to do

27
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.480
if you're using VS code is you can hit control + space.

28
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.900
When you have your cursor I think in the middle

29
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.530
or I usually have it at the end of the component here.

30
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.190
And that will bring up what's called code actions

31
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.900
in VS code and usually,

32
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.280
they will have a bunch of auto imports.

33
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.660
So let's see or in this one right here.

34
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.040
It's usually either this like

35
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.610
brick with squares around it or this cube.

36
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.440
And if you hover over top of it,

37
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.710
it'll say auto import nav element.

38
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.790
So I'll give that a click or just use your keyboard.

39
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.070
You can see that it automatically

40
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.790
added that import statement on top.

41
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.690
So that's almost what I do all the time.

42
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.210
I'll just use the component

43
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.200
and then it will give me a little red squiggle

44
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.300
and I'll have it auto import which is pretty cool.

45
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.590
Let's do the same for footer.

46
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.120
So we'll go into our components,

47
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.430
make a new file, call it capital F footer.js.

48
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.163
Import react from react.

49
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.073
Export default, function footer.

50
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.380
Then inside of that we'll just return a footer tag

51
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.003
that has a P just says footer.

52
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.740
And maybe let's do something,

53
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.573
let's do something better.

54
00:02:48.573 --> 00:02:53.530
We'll say and copy semi colon,

55
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.310
I'll say slick's slices and then we'll do

56
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.450
the current date and the way that you can get

57
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.100
the current date is just curly brackets.

58
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.560
So that lets JSX know that we're gonna run

59
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.480
a little bit of JavaScript right now.

60
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.480
And then in here, we'll say new date.get full year.

61
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.880
And that should bring in the current year.

62
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.730
Then we'll go back to our layout here

63
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.963
and give ourselves a footer tag.

64
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.730
And you notice I'm self closing these.

65
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.110
I certainly could also do open and close footer tag

66
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.180
and that just has to do with whether

67
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.710
there are children that are passed to that component.

68
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.730
And in our case, there's no children to the footer

69
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.410
and no children to the nav.

70
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.640
So we can just self close it like that.

71
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.700
Now you see here,

72
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.930
curly or we got squiggles underneath it.

73
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.460
So we wanna auto import it,

74
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.990
so we could be suckers and write it like that

75
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.440
or we could use the auto import.

76
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.380
I'm gonna hit my control + Space,

77
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.560
brings up code actions.

78
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.283
And then that pink cube is the auto import.

79
00:04:01.318 --> 00:04:03.970
And you'll see it automatically imported it for us.

80
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.770
Now how do we then use this layout that we have?

81
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.950
Well, we can go...

82
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.920
let's go into our index page.

83
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.010
And instead of having a div that wraps around

84
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.170
every one of our pages,

85
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.650
let's replace that div

86
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.490
with a capital L layout component that we just made.

87
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.950
Now, again we need to auto import.

88
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.500
You see why this thing is so handy.

89
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.670
I just quickly hit control + Space,

90
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.850
brought up my code actions, found my layout,

91
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.350
hit enter and imported all of the components there.

92
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.610
Now you'll see when we are visiting the homepage.

93
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.090
This is I am the page content.

94
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.150
You can still see our nav here.

95
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.933
Let's go to the pizzas page as well.

96
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.670
So that little shortcut that I just did there

97
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.570
was I hit command P.

98
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.030
I believe it's Ctrl + P on Windows

99
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.980
and that brought up my quick open,

100
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.810
rather than route around in the sidebar,

101
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.760
you can just search for a file that you want.

102
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.877
And I know it's called pizzas.jazz

103
00:05:06.877 --> 00:05:09.563
and it tells me it's in the pages directory.

104
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.993
I'll replace that with a layout again.

105
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.380
And we need to import it.

106
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.830
So anytime that you're using a component

107
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.210
in a file or another component in Gatsby

108
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.200
and this is just react in general,

109
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.660
you must import that component into that file.

110
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.080
So that's react basics

111
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.680
but I thought I mentioned just in case it's not known.

112
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.960
So I'm on the homepage now

113
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.610
and if I click on the pizza menu,

114
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.460
you see that we get the same thing.

115
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.570
So now the question is how do we get the content

116
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.050
that was passed down or put in between

117
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.170
the layout tag for each one?

118
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.780
Right? Let's go back to our layout component here

119
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.570
and we take a look at our layout

120
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.750
and every react component will receive

121
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.790
something that is called props

122
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.210
and props are things that are passed to the component.

123
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.580
So if we were to console.log,

124
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.160
the props of that component.

125
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.910
And I like to just give it a refresh

126
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.900
when we do something like that

127
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.970
cause sometimes a lot of garbage in the console here.

128
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.640
You'll see that props is an object, open that up

129
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.440
and there is only one prop and that is children.

130
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.190
But if someone were to use it...

131
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.023
What page is this?

132
00:06:25.023 --> 00:06:29.814
The index, if you were to say layout and age is equal to

133
00:06:29.814 --> 00:06:34.814
say 523, the first is equal to Wes.

134
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.490
And now you see when we refresh it,

135
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.550
you'll see that all of the things that were then passed

136
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.040
both as props into the component

137
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.660
as well as children are then gonna be showing up.

138
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.580
So in our case we don't really care about these things

139
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.450
but we do care about what children are being passed.

140
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.490
So you see here we got two children.

141
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.600
The first one is a nav component

142
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.250
and the second one is Hey! I am the homepage.

143
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.260
So how do we then render out what was passed to it?

144
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.660
Well we can go into our layout here

145
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.800
and replace the I Am the page content

146
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.590
with curly bracket, props.children.

147
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.870
Now you see if we go to our homepage,

148
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.020
it says I'm the homepage.

149
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.240
If we go to our pizza page,

150
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.970
it says I'm the pizzas page.

151
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.040
Our home page has a double nav going on here.

152
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.450
So let's take a look at that.

153
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.550
We no longer need to put the nav element

154
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.000
on each individual page

155
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.770
because that is now part of our layout component.

156
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.350
So we can get rid of that there.

157
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.170
You'll see it's now showing up.

158
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.610
A little bit further...

159
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.680
It's unlikely that or not unlikely

160
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.800
but you'll more commonly see

161
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.700
not the props object being passed as one big payload

162
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.560
and then accessing the things via .notation.

163
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.650
More often what you're going to see,

164
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.530
is you're gonna see this props object

165
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.870
being destructured in the function.

166
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.140
So what that means is that we just wanna pluck out

167
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.180
children from that prop.

168
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.040
So what we'll do is delete props use curly brackets,

169
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.440
that's to destructure the values

170
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.250
and then we'll just grab children directly

171
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.130
and put it into a top level variable.

172
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.100
You'll see now we don't have props variable.

173
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.100
And now we just have a variable called children.

174
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.970
You will see a little red underline here under my children.

175
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.080
It's telling us that it's missing in props validation.

176
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.020
And that's just telling us that generally

177
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.700
when you have a component that expects a prop,

178
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.980
you assign prop types to make sure that in development

179
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.670
it's being passed the proper things.

180
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.040
I'm gonna be leaving those out of this course.

181
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.750
Just because I know a lot of people rather use TypeScript

182
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.120
or they have their own way to do their props

183
00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.280
and it's a lot of typing for something that is very simple.

184
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.580
So I am going to be leaving them out

185
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.260
but I will leave the warnings in there.

186
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.540
You can turn them off on your ESN config if you'd like.

187
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.130
So that's our layout now

188
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.700
and if we want that to go on to our pizza page.

189
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.500
Let's go to our pizzas here.

190
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.980
We have that there.

191
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.400
Now, you may be asking okay,

192
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.470
why else do I need to then...

193
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.850
like put that on every single page

194
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.410
that I want it to show up?

195
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.920
And the answer is maybe.

196
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.050
So do you want every single page

197
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.200
to have the layout component wrapped around it?

198
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.130
Well, there's two options.

199
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.800
You can just go into every single page

200
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.820
and wrap your page in the layout component.

201
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.360
Or what we can do is we can take advantage

202
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.030
of some of the Gatsby custom files

203
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.300
that will automatically wrap them for us.

204
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.900
So those are referred to as the Gatsby browser

205
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.290
and the Gatsby SSR files.

206
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:58.290
So what we can do is we can go into our Gatsby main folder.

207
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.410
So not in the source folders is really important.

208
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.490
Again I'm gonna say not in the source folders

209
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.230
often I'll get people to make this file in the wrong folder

210
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.160
and then they lose their afternoon, that sucks.

211
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.160
So right in the Gatsby root folder,

212
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.120
we're going to make a special file

213
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.870
called Gatsby-browser.js.

214
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.060
And Gatsby-browser.js is a specific Gatsby file

215
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.500
that will allow us to hook into

216
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.580
different API's of Gatsby if we need to.

217
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.370
So by default Gatsby is not gonna

218
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.280
wrap your pages in a layout component

219
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.120
but if we want to we can hook into

220
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.230
the wrap page element hook

221
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.810
and Gatsby will automatically do that for us.

222
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.900
So we don't need to do it on every single page.

223
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.483
So we need to import react from react.

224
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.000
And then we will make a function

225
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.920
called wrap page element.

226
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.400
Now, you might be saying like

227
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.460
why did you call it that?

228
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.050
Well, if we Google that

229
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.490
and you'll see that that is in the Gatsby docs.

230
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.530
We search for it and you'll see it says

231
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.100
allow a plugin to wrap the page element.

232
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.330
So what we're essentially doing here

233
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.150
is we're making our own little plugin

234
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.970
that anytime Gatsby renders out a page,

235
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.010
it will wrap that in something.

236
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.400
So that will give us a couple arguments in there.

237
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.880
We get the element, the page element

238
00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.900
and then we also get the props that were then passed to it.

239
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.270
And from that we can return.

240
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:33.270 line:15% 
Let's just return like a div with a poop emoji in it.

241
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.190 line:15% 
And then finally, you need to export default.

242
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.420
No, no, not default, just export that function

243
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.640
and Gatsby's going to...

244
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.690
when it sort of fires up the browser,

245
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.320
It's gonna check this file

246
00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.570
for a function called wrap page element.

247
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.250
It's gonna say, "Hey, I'm about to like,

248
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.050
ship this page to the browser,

249
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.410
like do you wanna do anything?

250
00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.490
Like wrap the page element?"

251
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:04.140
In an our case we say, "Yeah, I wanna wrap it in her case

252
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.800
a div with the poop inside of it."

253
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.840
So now if we go back here

254
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.460
and refresh the page nothing happens.

255
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.933
Okay so this is something

256
00:12:11.933 --> 00:12:13.960
that will probably change in Gatsby

257
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.340
but right now whenever you modify one of these files,

258
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.280
you have to quit the build and restart it.

259
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.430
So we have to go back to our terminal here.

260
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.573
And I got to kill it with Control + C.

261
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.580
I always like to clear up my terminal

262
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.983
and then we run NPM start again.

263
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:33.940
And then wait for a second

264
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.760
for the entire build process to restart.

265
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.180
So again anytime we're working in Gatsby browser,

266
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.350
there's another one called Gatsby node,

267
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.510
Gatsby config and Gatsby SSR.

268
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.490
We'll learn about what those all are in this course.

269
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.440
You have to kill the process

270
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.840
or restart it that hopefully will change.

271
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.250
If you get a little pop up on your website

272
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.330
that says would you like to restart the build?

273
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.950
Then that will happen automatically.

274
00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.470
I'm hoping that will land pretty soon in Gatsby.

275
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.680
Looks like it's got up and running about

276
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.867
seven seconds now refresh the page(laughs).

277
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.360
And all we see is a poop.

278
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.480
Why? Because what we did is

279
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.330
we just have a react component here that returns a poop

280
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.130
and obviously that's not what we want.

281
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.790
We want a curly bracket and put the element inside of that

282
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.680
and then we also want to pass down any props

283
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.170
from the page element to our layout component.

284
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.990
So we'll say ...props and that is what is referred to as

285
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.090
a spread element.

286
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.160
We're getting a bit of an error here,

287
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.510
let's see what we got here.

288
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.520
React does not recognize the page resources

289
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.080
prop on a DOM element,

290
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.970
if you're intentionally wanting to appear...

291
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:45.900
Oh, okay.

292
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.820
That's because I'm using a DOM element here

293
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.120
and not a react component.

294
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.120
And most likely what we want

295
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.600
is we actually don't want div,

296
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.450
we want our layout components.

297
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.533
Let's do that. Capital L layout.

298
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.480
By the way this, you see how I'm typing

299
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.550
and it's renaming the closing tag as well.

300
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:12.550 line:15% 
That is an extension in VS code called auto rename tag.

301
00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.220 line:15% 
So if you want that one,

302
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.230
I'll maybe I'll stick that

303
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.320
in the list of recommended extensions as well.

304
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.640
So I think that's super handy for everybody.

305
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.240
So we have our layout.

306
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.633
Now we need to import it.

307
00:14:27.523 --> 00:14:29.053
Here we go. Here we go.

308
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.270
It's showing up on the homepage.

309
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.870
On every single page now that we go to,

310
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.520
we don't necessarily need to

311
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.040
wrap it in the layout component.

312
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.570
We're seeing double nav,

313
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.360
because if we go to our homepage,

314
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.120
we no longer need to manually wrap this layout here.

315
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.330
We can in our case,

316
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.840
we could simply just return the paragraph tag

317
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.170
or what I like to do is return

318
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.900
what's called a react fragment

319
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.700
and a react fragment is...

320
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.610
I like to think of it as a ghost element.

321
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.080
It will render out to nothing

322
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.490
and it will allow us to return two elements at once.

323
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.503
Hey, I'm another element.

324
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.520
And see if I were to just return two paragraph tags,

325
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:21.530
It yells at us about returning adjacent JSX LMC

326
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.810
can't return two or more things always must be one.

327
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.490
So if that's what you want,

328
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.690
then you have to put react fragments

329
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.090
around our ghost elements and everything will work.

330
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.770
So let's go through our pages real quick.

331
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.950
And make sure that we're no longer

332
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.160
wrapping in a layout.

333
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.893
So 404 is fine.

334
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.140
Our beers page we no longer need this div.

335
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.943 line:15% 
We no longer need the nav.

336
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.350 line:15% 
Index page is fine. Order page is fine.

337
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.483
Actually we don't need that.

338
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.930
Pizzas page no longer need the layout

339
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.380
cause that automatically happens.

340
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.930
Let's make it a react fragment.

341
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.140
Again you don't need to hear and watch.

342
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.570
If I remove that fragment

343
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.210
and just return a paragraph tag, It still works

344
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:13.230
but more than likely,

345
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.640
you don't just want a paragraph tag,

346
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.990
you're gonna want divs and all kinds of interesting stuff.

347
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.740
So I like to start with the fragment.

348
00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.190
And then finally slice masters

349
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:26.030
don't need the nav, don't need that.

350
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.100
So nice and clean way.

351
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:33.100
Finally, this only works in the browser

352
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.150
which is why we put it in Gatsbybrowser.js.

353
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.290
So we also need to put it in another file

354
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.660
that's called Gatsby-SSR.

355
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.510
And the difference between those two files

356
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.720
is that Gatsby browser will run

357
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.640
once the page has been loaded.

358
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.950
And once the page has been generated in the browser

359
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:55.950
but Gatsby also generates everything on the server

360
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.160
so that it's server rendered and really fast.

361
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.260
So we need to create another file in here

362
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:08.260 line:15% 
that is called Gatsby-ssr.js.

363
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.170 line:15% 
Again that is in the root of the folder.

364
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.460
And you can literally just copy everything

365
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.840
from Gatsby browser and paste it right in there.

366
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.650
You could even import this function

367
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.820
and export it directly but let's just keep it simple here.

368
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.380
So that is how you do layouts in Gatsby.

369
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.350
We're going to jump into some CSS pretty soon

370
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.070
and start to get this thing

371
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.687
looking like a decent website now.
