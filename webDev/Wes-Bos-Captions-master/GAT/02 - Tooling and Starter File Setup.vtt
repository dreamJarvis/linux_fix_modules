00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.243
<v Trainer>All right.</v>

2
00:00:06.243 --> 00:00:07.076
Let's talk a little bit about the starter files

3
00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:08.450
that you need to get up and running

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.130
in the tooling that you need.

5
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.340
So, first of all, when you log into your course manager,

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.260
you'll see there's a button under the course

7
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.500
that you are taking right now.

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.840
It's called Master Gatsby.

9
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.100
There should be a starter files and step solutions.

10
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.120
That's going to link you off to the GitHub

11
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.070
and on the GitHub, you're gonna have a directory

12
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.520
full of couple more directories.

13
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.720
So we'll have the finished files.

14
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.650
That's the sort of the end thing.

15
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.620
If you ever want to check out how it works at the very end,

16
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.820
we'll have a starter files,

17
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.440
which is what we actually going to be working with

18
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.273
right now.

19
00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:40.370
And then there'll be a third folder,

20
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.100
which has step solutions.

21
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.010
And inside of that, you're gonna see folders

22
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.030
that correspond with the video number.

23
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.130
And if you ever want to be able to grab copy paste,

24
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.570
reference the code that we write in a video,

25
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.060
you can grab it from there.

26
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.010
So, first of all, before we even get into that,

27
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.970
you need a few things downloaded, installed.

28
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.020
You need the latest version of Node.js, all of the tooling,

29
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.070
as well as the backend server that we're gonna be doing

30
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.680
that all runs on Node.js.

31
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.310
So go to Node.js.org, click through to downloads,

32
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.350
and you can grab the latest version of node.

33
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.760
It doesn't really matter if the version is greater

34
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.640
than what you're seeing on the screen right here,

35
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.690
they released a new version all the time.

36
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.120
So even if it's 25,

37
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.450
don't sweat that you can just go ahead and grab

38
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.580
the latest version.

39
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.810
If there are any incompatibilities with the course,

40
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.770
I'll make sure to update the starter files

41
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.230
or the video to reflect that.

42
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.610
So go ahead, grab the installer for whichever OS

43
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.123
you currently are on.

44
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.660
There's LTS and current, I recommend you grab current.

45
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.100
That's always the most up to date.

46
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.740
If you aren't sure if you have Node.js installed or not,

47
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.140
go ahead and grab a terminal application.

48
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.600
And I'm gonna assume that you know what a terminal is.

49
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.040
We don't use it all that much in here,

50
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.580
but we do use it to start and close our things.

51
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.970
I'm using one called hyper, which is really good.

52
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.370
There's also, iTerm2, there's one built into windows.

53
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.700
There's one built into OS X, it's under utilities folder.

54
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.620
There's one in Linux.

55
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.000
If you know, if you're using Linux,

56
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.440
you know that there's a terminal in it.

57
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.960
So go ahead and grab those.

58
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.680
If yours looks a little bit different than mine,

59
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.950
that's totally fine.

60
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.490
If you go to WesBos.Com/Uses,

61
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.640
there's a link to all the themes and tools and everything

62
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.283
I use to get it, to look exactly like this.

63
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.010
Next we need a code editor, I will be using VS Code.

64
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.910
And you're welcome to use any code editor that you want,

65
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.560
or however, all of the kind of tips and tricks

66
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.820
that I have throughout this course,

67
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.490
will be, I think a lot of them are specific to VS Code.

68
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.840
So that's somewhat important.

69
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.543
When you install VS Code and you open it on app.

70
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.460
One thing I want you to do is to open up your command power

71
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.150
and you can do that by hitting command shift P,

72
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.310
and then just typing install.

73
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.340
And you're gonna see this something right here

74
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.233
is Shell Command install, code command in path.

75
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.570
And then what that will do is when you go to your terminal,

76
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.530
you're gonna be able to open up a folder

77
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.820
or anything like that,

78
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.100
just by typing the code and then the name of the file

79
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.540
or the folder that you want.

80
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.890
So if you type code --version,

81
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.220
and it gives you some sort of number, then that's great.

82
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.430
I mean, that has successfully installed.

83
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.640
You don't absolutely need that for this course,

84
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.780
but it's a handy little helper.

85
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.470
So let's talk about the starter files now.

86
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.060
So we'll go over to the GitHub here.

87
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.740
You can go ahead and clone them to your own, Git-repo,

88
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.870
or just go ahead and download the zip that we have there.

89
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.930
And once you've opened up the zip, you'll see,

90
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.110
have you ever starter files,

91
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.240
inside there we have two different folders.

92
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.510
Now this course is gonna have a front end Gatsby,

93
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.810
and it's going to have a backend, which is sanity.

94
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.770
And I always like to keep my front end and my backend

95
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.680
totally separate because they have their own dependencies.

96
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.710
They have their own settings.

97
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.470
They deploy to different places.

98
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.520
So keeping them in their own folder keeps it nice and clean

99
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.353
and separate.

100
00:04:09.353 --> 00:04:13.240
And I even like to go one step further and keep them open

101
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.220
and separate editor tabs, which is pretty cool.

102
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.220
So go ahead and go into your starter files

103
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.270
and grab the sanity and the Gatsby folders.

104
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.290
And you can either rename the starter files directory

105
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.730
to something like working or Slick's Slices

106
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.550
is the app that we're going to be building.

107
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.220
Or I like to just take it out of here entirely

108
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.800
and then paste it into,

109
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.220
I've got a folder in the root of my computer here

110
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.970
called Master Gatsby.

111
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.203
And I've got both of those in there.

112
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.903
Next up.

113
00:04:45.903 --> 00:04:48.730
We want to open up our terminal and we want to go

114
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.920
to the Master Gatsby folder.

115
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.780
So I am going to type CD till master Gatsby.

116
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.410
I'm gonna assume you know how to get to specific folders

117
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.270
in your terminal.

118
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.970
If you are unfamiliar with that, you can type CD space.

119
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.170
And then you can just take the folder that you want

120
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.500
and drag and drop that into your editor.

121
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.320
And that will auto complete where that folder actually is

122
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.600
in your editor.

123
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.520
So we want to go in one tab, go into the Gatsby folder,

124
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.430
and then another tab we want to go into the sanity folder.

125
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.350
So let's go into Gatsby here, CD space Gatsby,

126
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.150
and then I'm going to open up another tab

127
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.610
in my terminal here,

128
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.900
go into my master Gatsby folder

129
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.250
and then into my sanity folder.

130
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.470
Now both of these projects have

131
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.640
what are called dependencies,

132
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.290
things that are needed for them to run, things like Gatsby,

133
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.520
core react, bunch of tooling to get it up and running.

134
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.450
So what we need to do to install that

135
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.720
it's just type npm install,

136
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.163
and then go over to the sanity tab and type npm install.

137
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.440
And we'll just give that a second to go off to the internet

138
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.700
and to download all of the dependencies that we need

139
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.963
for this thing to run.

140
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.320
So once it's done finished,

141
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.190
you might be a little bit scared at this point

142
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.300
'cause node and NPM just puke a whole bunch of stuff,

143
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.410
you get this like,

144
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.410
so link module, core JS, not sure what that is.

145
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.420
And then you get these, these people asking you for money.

146
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.080
Then you get these probably seven or thousand warnings,

147
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.350
usually more than one and warnings that mean nothing,

148
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.750
which is good.

149
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.120
And then you also will see that any,

150
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.990
if there's any security vulnerabilities

151
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.870
and you'll most likely see security vulnerabilities

152
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.800
and don't freak out because I keep an eye on them.

153
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.450
But even if like sometimes I go to projects

154
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.300
that are a week older

155
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.980
and there's 7,000 security vulnerabilities.

156
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.370
Don't freak out because I will keep those up to date,

157
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.690
but also almost never are they actually vulnerabilities

158
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.650
that make their way into the code that you're writing.

159
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.900
So keep the versions of everything that we have in here

160
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.050
locked to what I have in the Git-repo.

161
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.710
Because if you were to update to an incompatible version

162
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.690
with this course, you're gonna have a bad time.

163
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.650
So I will keep the versions in the package this one

164
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.090
locked to the versions that we need.

165
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.600
In this case look, there's zero here,

166
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.910
but I'm sure by the time I wake up tomorrow morning,

167
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:20.840
there'll be a whole bunch.

168
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.673
Look at it.

169
00:07:21.673 --> 00:07:23.110
There's a bunch of stuff in here.

170
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.430
Next we need to do is install a little bit of global tooling

171
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.263
via NPM.

172
00:07:27.263 --> 00:07:30.170
And it's gonna clear this out with command K.

173
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.310
And the two things that we need are the Gatsby CLI

174
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.130
and the sanity CLI.

175
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.200
So that we can install those globally by typing.

176
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.033
If you're on a Mac,

177
00:07:40.033 --> 00:07:42.880
usually have to type sudo and then type

178
00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:49.672
npm install gatsby-cli @sanity/cli -g,

179
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.030
and that will install them globally on your computer.

180
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.150
Go ahead and hit enter.

181
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.850
It might ask you for your password

182
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.080
and then it will spew a whole bunch of more stuff

183
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.290
into your terminal and eventually be fixed.

184
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.980
Mine just finished here and you can see it.

185
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.550
It actually didn't work.

186
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.480
I get an error warnings are usually fine,

187
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.050
errors or means something went wrong.

188
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.410
It's cause I already have them installed,

189
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.980
but you can test if you have them installed properly

190
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.980
by just typing Gatsby --version, and sanity --version.

191
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.360
And that will show you if you have something installed,

192
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.850
we'll go into what those are and when we need them.

193
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.590
But that's some of the tooling that we need.

194
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.460
Finally, we need to talk about ESLint and Prettier.

195
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.160
So a lot of the times I'm gonna be writing some code

196
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.370
and I'm gonna hit save.

197
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.530
And it's gonna magically sort of just jump,

198
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.990
it's going to get formatted nicely,

199
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.497
quotes will be changed, unneeded spaces.

200
00:08:46.497 --> 00:08:49.710
Let we'll turn to cons if it's necessary.

201
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.640
A lot of those little quick fixes when I hit save,

202
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.280
those are happening because of two, ESLint,

203
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.170
as well as Prettier.

204
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.360
Prettier generally focuses on formatting

205
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.690
and ESLint focuses on code quality or possible issues

206
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.560
that might pop up

207
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.030
and we'll see plenty of plenty of issues like that

208
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.863
pop up.

209
00:09:10.863 --> 00:09:14.130
But I want to just to show you how to get them,

210
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.530
how to get it working so that when I hit save

211
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.780
yours will likely do the same thing.

212
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.910
And this is totally optional.

213
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.880
You may already have be opinionated about your setup.

214
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.500
So feel free to just end this video now

215
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.780
and go on to the next one.

216
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.170
So what we want to do is we want to open both

217
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.440
the Gatsby folder and the sanity folder in VS Code.

218
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.770
And I want to use my own VS Code for each of them.

219
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.080
So if you just type code space dot on Gatsby,

220
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.690
and if you typed code space dot on sanity,

221
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.870
you'll see that they're gonna open up in VS Code

222
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.890
and you'll see that, Ooh,

223
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.120
they have their own nice little colors here.

224
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.180
And I've done that to separate the difference

225
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.740
between front end, yellow and backend, which is pink.

226
00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.160
You can change the colors if you want in your settings

227
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.320
based on, file right here.

228
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.310
But I recommend keeping them the same as to what I have

229
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.143
in here.

230
00:10:06.143 --> 00:10:07.750
Now, when you open that on up,

231
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.330
you probably will see something

232
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.700
in the bottom right hand corner

233
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.300
that says install recommended packages.

234
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.730
So there's two packages that I recommend for you.

235
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.563
If you don't see it,

236
00:10:16.563 --> 00:10:20.010
you can open up your extensions in VS Code

237
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.793
and just type @recommended.

238
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.690
And that's going to tell you, workspace recommended

239
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.510
ESLint and Cobalt2.

240
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.210
So ESLint is the plugin hat's gonna actually fix our code

241
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.043
for us.

242
00:10:31.043 --> 00:10:32.970
And it uses Prettier under the hood.

243
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.660
And Cobalt2 is a theme I use,

244
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.610
you don't have to install this

245
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.633
because that's the theme that I use.

246
00:10:37.633 --> 00:10:40.210
If you're into it, then you can install it.

247
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.050
I just put that in there.

248
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.890
Cause a lot of people want to get the same theme.

249
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.890
It looks the same when you're coding as to

250
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.750
what's on my screen.

251
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.923
But we need to install the ESLint,

252
00:10:48.923 --> 00:10:50.740
go ahead and install that.

253
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.780
And then quit VS Code entirely.

254
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.130
Don't just close the window, but go to the icon and quit it.

255
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.860
You're not, you don't necessarily have to,

256
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.910
but in my experience it never works

257
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.440
without somebody totally quitting it and starting it

258
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.010
right on up.

259
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.980
Then when you open it up again

260
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.540
and you open up any JavaScript file.

261
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.080
So we don't have any JavaScript files yet,

262
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.010
but maybe if you open,

263
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.890
make a new file called delete me .js,

264
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.010
and you do something like let age or no,

265
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:21.843
let's just do this.

266
00:11:21.843 --> 00:11:22.676
Age = 100.

267
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.740
And if you hover over top of that,

268
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.480
it's going to say like age is not defined

269
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.000
and it's missing a semi-colon, right?

270
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.053
So watch when I hit save,

271
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.760
you'll see that it auto fixed that

272
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.540
and this one can't get auto fix.

273
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.550
So if I put a constant front of that, it gets fixed.

274
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.410
So there's a lot of like weird things

275
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.360
where you say like const names = 'Wes'.

276
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.330
And to give it a save.

277
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.000
I like to use single quotes instead of double quotes.

278
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.030
So when I hit save and I've accidentally used double quotes,

279
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.070
it will just change them over.

280
00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:58.903
You see that?

281
00:11:58.903 --> 00:12:00.410
I put some extra spaces in there.

282
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:01.410
That's unnecessary.

283
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.243
I hit save.

284
00:12:02.243 --> 00:12:03.390
It, takes them out of there.

285
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.310
That is huge.

286
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.019
If you're a beginner programmer,

287
00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:12.019
I really suggest that you use this because it's really easy.

288
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.300
And you can certainly,

289
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.090
if you're interested on how to tweak it, Wes,

290
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.520
I don't like semi-colons, I like double quotes.

291
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.210
I don't like all of them.

292
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.513
Just search, no sweat ESLint.

293
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.433
There we go.

294
00:12:24.433 --> 00:12:27.340
No sweat ESLint and Ooh,

295
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.160
no sweat music video.

296
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.993
That seems cool.

297
00:12:29.993 --> 00:12:30.826
Don't watch.

298
00:12:30.826 --> 00:12:33.440
Watch that after, but search for the

299
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.073
ESLint Prettier VS Code, perfect setup,

300
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.330
or go to the GitHub, ESLint config Wes Bos.

301
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.560
And you'll see both my settings

302
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.070
as well as how to override them.

303
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.920
If you don't like a specific setting,

304
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.960
that's the most I'll go into that in this thing.

305
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.050
Cause I've talked about it many times over

306
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.610
and you can watch that video if you're interested.

307
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.250
So I'm going to delete that file.

308
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.083
Other than that,

309
00:12:58.083 --> 00:13:00.840
you don't need to do that for every both of them.

310
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.670
You notice I did it in sanity here

311
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.210
and if you go over to Gatsby, it will work in Gatsby,

312
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.840
that's because we've,

313
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.370
I've set up the ESLint package to work

314
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.250
in both Gatsby and sanity.

315
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.220
So you don't need to install twice just once.

316
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.053
That's it.

317
00:13:15.053 --> 00:13:16.050
I'll catch you in the next one

318
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.700
and let's get right in some code.
