00:00:00.377 --> 00:00:02.960
(bright music)

2
00:00:04.723 --> 00:00:05.556
<v Instructor>Alright, now we're gonna move</v>

3
00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:06.389
on to typography.

4
00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:07.222
This will be a quick video,

5
00:00:07.222 --> 00:00:09.500
it's essentially just more global styles.

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.880
However, I like to keep them in their own file,

7
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.240
because I know that if there's a global type style

8
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.210
that you need to adjust, a font,

9
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.440
a base color, something like that that needs to be done,

10
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.090
I go into my typography file.

11
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.207
So we'll go to our styles file here.

12
00:00:23.207 --> 00:00:24.043
(laughs)

13
00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:26.750
Here, over here.

14
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.470 line:15% 
And we'll make a Typography.js capital T file.

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.270
And I'm going to get you a copy paste this one,

16
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.550
I'm not going to make you copy and paste

17
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.890
everything in this course,

18
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.500
but for this base stuff,

19
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.660
it's so simple that there's no sense

20
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.030
in spending a lot of time on that.

21
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.470
So we'll go into our source, components, no.

22
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.980 line:15% 
Styles, Typography.js.

23
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.580 line:15% 
Click raw, grab it, let's go through it real quick.

24
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.540
So I'm grabbing the createGlobalStyle again

25
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.440
to insert global styles into our application,

26
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.660
this is important, this is another time

27
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.280
where we make sure that all of our files

28
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.970
and assets go through Gatsby.

29
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.180
So here I am importing the font into Gatsby

30
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.960
and its a woff file.

31
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.240
And then what I do is simply by importing that,

32
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.240
what it will do is it will put the URL of the font

33
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.960
into this variable called "font"

34
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.070
and then that allows me to go ahead and use that

35
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.410
when I declare my font face.

36
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.680
And that's great, because Gatsby's gonna

37
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.800
take it out of our assets folder

38
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.750
and put it into our static folder for us, which is great.

39
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.603
Then also what do we do here?

40
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.580
I said a base font stack on our HTML,

41
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.460 line:15% 
that makes sure that you don't have any weird

42
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.620 line:15% 
Times New Roman sneak up on buttons

43
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.520 line:15% 
so there's some weird stuff like that.

44
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.750
Then letter spacing, some h1 through h6.

45
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.340
Then we've got our links, we've got some helper,

46
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.160
so I have a mark tag and anything with

47
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.670
a class of mark will hit this black,

48
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.960
or sorry, this yellow background with some padding,

49
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.980
inline, line-height, you get the point.

50
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.690
And then anything that needs a tilt, I add a tilt.

51
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.900
These are just global classes that I'm adding

52
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.373
and I can slap 'em on,

53
00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:21.820
then I go ahead and export that,

54
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.080
and we'll go into our layout.js,

55
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.130
and we'll simply just duplicate that.

56
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.623
Typography, then we'll autoimport it.

57
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.530
Boom.

58
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.430
And now if we go to our application here

59
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.930
you'll see, we've got this French Fries font,

60
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.360
it's showing, oh, hold on.

61
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.670
This is not, no.

62
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.280
We don't need this.

63
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.570
I put this font stack here,

64
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.490
but then I'm just immediately overwriting it

65
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.080
with this font family right here.

66
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.500
So actually what we need to do,

67
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.800
and this might already be in the finished solution,

68
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.160
is put FrenchFries, and then comma,

69
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.820
and that will make sure our font stack has the proper font.

70
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.520
So there we go, there's that French Fries font,

71
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.710
obviously you don't have to use it,

72
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.320
but I think it looks kinda cool,

73
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.480
and it's a custom font that we've put in.

74
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.360
So, that's typography, we'll probably jump into that

75
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.730
a few more times here or there

76
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.260
if we need to add some type styles,

77
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.110
but for now, let's get into the rest.
