1
00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:02.819
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.680
<v ->All right let's uh - let's pull those beer and display</v>

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.880
them on a page. This is not in the menu.

4
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.810
You could maybe put a link in the footer if you wanted to,

5
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.650
but it's just forward slash beers.

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.240
Uh, we'll go ahead and open up 'Beers.js', and we've just

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.710
got to react and we have our simple ham on the Beer page.

8
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.730
So, first thing we need to do is query the data.

9
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.730
Then, we'll loop over it and display it

10
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.693
and then we'll style it and that's kind of that whole

11
00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.460
song and dance with Gatsby.

12
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.950
Um, you do that over and over and over

13
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.140
til you've done your website.

14
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.140
So, we'll export, const query is equal to graphql.

15
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.580
Um, you gotta spell const right, and then we need to

16
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.580
auto import 'graphql'. So, import 'graphql' from Gatsby.

17
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.900
So, now what do the query look like?

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.500
Well, we wrote a query right here.

19
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.665
So, the query is 'allbeer', and then you have 'nodes'

20
00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:00.750
name and all of it.

21
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.797
So, we go here. Say query.

22
00:01:02.797 --> 00:01:04.963
Allbeer, so singular.

23
00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:07.700
And then we have the nodes.

24
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.090
And for each node, we want the ID, the name,

25
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.690
the price, the image, um and then the rating.

26
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.380
And inside the rating, it's uh the average and reviews.

27
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.600
Okay, and we'll go up to our BeersPage here and destructure

28
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.060
that data and then let's just consol that log, that data.

29
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.970
Just to make sure it's being pulled in properly.

30
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.003
So, here.

31
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.100
Open up your rev tools. There we go.

32
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.173
Object, Allbeer, nodes.

33
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.880
Okay.

34
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.240
Let's actually rename this to 'beers' instead of 'allbeer'.

35
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.457
Now, in here. We will give ourselves an 'h2'.

36
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.593
Um, actually 'h2' with a class of center.

37
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.290
And then inside of that we want something that says,

38
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.370
'We have' and we want to list how many beers are available.

39
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.870
So, 'data.beer.nodes.lengths'.

40
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.230
Um, 'Beers Available. Dine In Only'.

41
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.330
The reason I put that, is cause we're not - we're not

42
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.460
including this in the order form that we're going to build.

43
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.440
Um, coming up. So, we have a hundred and - oops.

44
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.890
Dollar sign's not needed.

45
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.080
We have a 141 beers available dine in only.

46
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.400
Good. Okay.

47
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.310
Next, what we need to do is to loop over them.

48
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.000
So give ourselves a 'div' and in that we will take

49
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
our 'data.beers.nodes.map', singular beer.

50
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.113
And for each one,

51
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.730
we will um return -

52
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.720
I'm just gonna 'consl.log' beer here um just because

53
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.900
if I don't put some some code right here and I save it

54
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.370
um I pretier converts it to an implicit return,

55
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.000
which I don't want in this case.

56
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.852
So, 'return' um parenthesis

57
00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:09.300
in there we'll give ourselves another 'div'

58
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.140
and an 'h3'

59
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.570
as the 'beer.name'.

60
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.653
Let's just make sure we can loop over every single one.

61
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.940
Okay, good we got them all showing up. Yup.

62
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.233
Um next, we need to put a key on that.

63
00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:32.210
'Beer.id' and we'll go here and we'll give ourselves

64
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.670
an image tag. So, this is not using Gatsby image, um

65
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.460
because these images are hosted externally.

66
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.030
But if you wanted to you could in your Gatsby node,

67
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.430
you'd have to download the images and then further source

68
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.230
those images into Gatsby. Um, but in our case

69
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.100
they're already sized and ready to go, so, we can

70
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.500
use them right off the hosted.

71
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.819
So, 'Beer.image' and the alt for that will be the

72
00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.937
'Beer.name'.

73
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.757
Below that let's do the 'Beer.price'.

74
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.420
Good.

75
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.950
All right so, we got a Guinness Extra Shout, 8.99.

76
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.740
Looks like a bunch of our beers are showing up.

77
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.130
Which is great. Okay.

78
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.230
Um next, what we need to do it the rating.

79
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.220
Um so we want to know what the rating is out of 5 stars.

80
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.410
If we take a look at each beer rating.

81
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.690
So open one up. A rating, uh, 2.8

82
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.040
out of 470 reviews.

83
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.970
So what we wanna do is, round that up or down to the

84
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.340
closest star. We wanna show how many stars we have.

85
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.990
So let's to here we'll say const rating is equal to

86
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.367
'math.round',

87
00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:56.307
'beer.rating.average'.

88
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.258
And we'll go down here and give ourselves a paragraph. Tag.

89
00:05:01.258 --> 00:05:03.610
And we'll need to show how many stars it has.

90
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.173
So, let's take the star emoji,

91
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.303
and repeat it.

92
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.143
How ever many ratings it has,

93
00:05:18.887 --> 00:05:20.030
so that gives us four,

94
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.340
three, one.

95
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.740
Oh, New Holland, not doing too well.

96
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.060
Um now we need to show the rest of them.

97
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.483
Which is five minus whatever the rating is.

98
00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:36.390
So, put this on it's own line. Duplicate that.

99
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.263
And repeat five minus the actual rating.

100
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.640
Now, they're are all - we need to like, uh style them

101
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.263
somehow. What I like to do, is to take a 'span'

102
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.430
and go up here and just do some in line styles right in,

103
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.220
in - we could put a class on this and target it later.

104
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.010
But, let's just do it right in line.

105
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.130
Style is equal to, you do double curly brackets.

106
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.130
Uh, filter and we want to use gray scale, 100%.

107
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.870
That should make them gray. Yeah, good.

108
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.880
Um, now that's not very accessible because um

109
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.970
people who do not have sight or have poor sight

110
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.100
will not be able to see. All they will see is 5 stars.

111
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.440
They're all 5 stars, right?

112
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.710
So, in order to do that, we have to put

113
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.513
a title tag on that,

114
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.300
um, and we'll give it a

115
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.700
rating out of 5 stars,

116
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.300
and that will make it accessible

117
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.347
so that if someone with a screen reader goes over

118
00:06:43.347 --> 00:06:46.420
this paragraph tag it will tell them 4 out of 5 stars.

119
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.830
And same thing, you could just hover over

120
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.020
it with you mouse.

121
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.470
Um, which is, pretty cool.

122
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.780
Um, we also want to give it the count.

123
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.460
So, let's give it another span, in parenthesis we'll say

124
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.337
'beer.rating.reviews'.

125
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.010
That just tells us how many people have reviewed

126
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.463
that specific beer.

127
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.080
Okay, so, we've got all of our data showing up now.

128
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.410
Let's do some quick CSS, so we can have

129
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.790
a bit of a grid for it.

130
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.160
So, uh, let's go, uh (tongue clicking).

131
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.703
This div right here.

132
00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:29.643
Const BeerGridStyles is equal to 'style.div'.

133
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.703
We need to import style from style components.

134
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.826
Display grid.

135
00:07:42.826 --> 00:07:44.893
Grid, gap or we could just use gap.

136
00:07:46.158 --> 00:07:50.120
2rem maybe. Uh grid template columns.

137
00:07:53.703 --> 00:07:57.503
Let's do repeat auto fit.

138
00:08:00.503 --> 00:08:02.640
Is it auto dash fit? Let's see.

139
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.610
Minmax, I always forget.

140
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.360
I have an entire course on CSS Grid and

141
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.550
I can't remember. I think it's dash.

142
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.690
At a minimum you want it to be 200 px

143
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.870
and a maximum 1fr.

144
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.620
Let's see what we're working with there.

145
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.880
Uh, nothing because I didn't use it yet.

146
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.330
So, let's take that div, that surrounds everything

147
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.280
and replace it with our BeerGridStyles.

148
00:08:25.162 --> 00:08:26.800
There we go.

149
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.340
Uh, looks like that image is broken right now,

150
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.593
but it should come back.

151
00:08:31.807 --> 00:08:32.890
Looking good!

152
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.280
Now let's take the actual beer style.

153
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.830
So, singular beer um and in this case if we want to use

154
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.040
style a single beer, we could select it from within here

155
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.320
like '.beer' or we could make another style component.

156
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.153
Um, I'm going to show you how

157
00:08:51.153 --> 00:08:52.600
to make another style component.

158
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.550
Const capital S, SingleBeerStyle,

159
00:08:58.171 --> 00:08:59.754
so put 'style.div',

160
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.813
and

161
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.700
in that let's just border 1px solid

162
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.360
var gray -

163
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.460
I forgot to use it!

164
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.520
I've got to put it in here,

165
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.060
so keep the key but replace the 'div'

166
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.187
with 'SingleBeerStyles'.

167
00:09:19.576 --> 00:09:20.409
There we go!

168
00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:21.520
Now it's starting to look good.

169
00:09:22.715 --> 00:09:23.890
Um, let's go up here.

170
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.770
Padding 2rem. Text align center. `

171
00:09:30.605 --> 00:09:31.438
There we go.

172
00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:33.483
Um, we'll do...image.

173
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.273
Width is 100%,

174
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.080
height is 200px.

175
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.670
Let's see how big that is.

176
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.660
Okay. Now these are stretched in some cases.

177
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.930
If that's the case, like here -

178
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.180
let me show you a really extreme example.

179
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.690
If I do 600px, like look at this.

180
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.690
If you want the image to be that big,

181
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.360
most of them will be stretched.

182
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.000
So what you can do is you can say is,

183
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.800
object fit, either cover

184
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.230
and that will zoom it up

185
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.290
and crop it or object fit contain,

186
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.970
and that will make sure the entire,

187
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.400
regardless of the width and the height of that image

188
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.710
it will actually fit it inside, so.

189
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.210
Let's stick to 200px, there we go.

190
00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.563
Um, let's see this one.

191
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.160
It's not showing up.

192
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.463
Um, let me just display block on that.

193
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.900
There we go.

194
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.010
Um, and even in this image,

195
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.590
if I want this tacs to be centered

196
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.843
I can say display grid.

197
00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:51.023
And align items center.

198
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.290
Yeah!!

199
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.163
Font size 10px,

200
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.373
color var gray.

201
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.490
Background, actually don't take... not -

202
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.023
We'll do background gray.

203
00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:13.740
Ummm.

204
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.573
No.

205
00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:17.490
Some of these are - we won't do background gray.

206
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.923
We'll just say, color is gray.

207
00:11:21.397 --> 00:11:24.500
That is too light, that - that inaccessible gray.

208
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.900
Um, so we need to make that, let's just make them

209
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.500
we'll keep them black, you know.

210
00:11:30.517 --> 00:11:32.110
I think that, that pretty good.

211
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.670
All right, good! So we've got this showing up.

212
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.120
Let's just make sure that it's like responsive.

213
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.730
We'll go through and make sure this whole thing is

214
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.409
responsive, but what I like using about grid is that,

215
00:11:39.409 --> 00:11:42.110
it's just responsive by nature.

216
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:47.110
If you use this little auto fit, minmax ditty right here.

217
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.420
Um, good! I think that's, that's, that's it.

218
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.800
Um, we sourced the data.

219
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.990
We put it into our graph gil guy.

220
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.720
We queried it, we looped over it.

221
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.553
We styled it.

222
00:11:57.553 --> 00:11:59.203
And now we're done! See ya.
