00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.430
<v Instructor>The last video,</v>

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.110
we looked at how to actually create

4
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.980
the pages for the pagination that we need.

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.290
In this video we are going

6
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.250
to modify our query,

7
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.360
to actually only show us two or four per page.

8
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.900
Right now we've got it, to set to two,

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.750
people per page.

10
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.690
So, let's go into our slicemasters.JS,

11
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.040
and let's modify this query here to accept some variables.

12
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.540
So, remember that any context

13
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.200
that gets passed via create page

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.780
is automatically available inside of your GraphQL query,

15
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.550
as long as you specify it

16
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.800
when you're writing your query.

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.073
So we'll go into our query here,

18
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.493
we're expecting a skip variable to be passed.

19
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.370
And that will be an integer that is required,

20
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.900
and set to zero by default.

21
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.570
Actually, I don't think that's required then,

22
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.093
because if we go to Slice Masters.

23
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.410
Then it's not going to be passed.

24
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.113
Because if we're not on any page at all,

25
00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:15.690
We might come back to that, we'll see.

26
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.260
And then we also need the,

27
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.060
page size variable.

28
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.610
And that is going to be an integer,

29
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.460
that is set to four by default.

30
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.423
And that little backup there is just in case,

31
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.190
just in case it gets passed undefined

32
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.023
or something like that.

33
00:01:34.023 --> 00:01:36.130
It's nice to have a little default.

34
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.410
So, what this does is it sets up our query

35
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.120
to accept variables.

36
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.200
Then we can go ahead,

37
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.590
and use those variables

38
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.927
and pass them to,

39
00:01:43.927 --> 00:01:47.053
our GraphQL query.

40
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.253
If we go to our GraphQL API,

41
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.713
let's take a look underscore,

42
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.080
GraphQL, here we go.

43
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.470
If we have our all sanity person,

44
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.040
you'll see that there are some functions here we can use.

45
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.030
We can filter them, we can limit them,

46
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.010
we can skip them,

47
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.510
and we can sort them.

48
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.523
So in our case, we want to,

49
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.910
if we wanna limit them,

50
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.800
now maybe limit them to two.

51
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.500
If you run that,

52
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.940
it just brings us back.

53
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.690
Oh, I forgot to.

54
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.743
Give me their name.

55
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.730
It just gives us two people, right?

56
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.400
So we get August and Slick,

57
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.350
but then also we have skip.

58
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.210
If you wanna skip to,

59
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.380
we're still going to get two,

60
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.520
but it's gonna give us

61
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.910
the third and fourth Louise and Roscoe,

62
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.490
cause those are the third and fourth.

63
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.560
And it still tells us

64
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.830
they're 10 in total.

65
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.130
But, we now see the skip values.

66
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.940
So that's limit and skip,

67
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.140
And we're gonna pass those values our variable.

68
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.220
So filter no,

69
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.590
not filter,

70
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.140
limit

71
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.973
to

72
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.260
a page size

73
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.110
and skip

74
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.943
is gonna be,

75
00:02:59.943 --> 00:03:01.000
our skip

76
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.313
variable.

77
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.490
All right.

78
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.500
So, give that a save.

79
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.333
Now we go here,

80
00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:10.620
hey, look at this.

81
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.900
So we're on page four.

82
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.550
We see Waldo and Fia.

83
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.720
If you go to

84
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.803
page two,

85
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.240
you'll see Louise and Roscoe.

86
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.930
If you go to page one,

87
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.160
you see August and Slick.

88
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.610
And then also if we just go

89
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.853
to straight Slice Masters.

90
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.960
Oh, we see four there.

91
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.023
How come?

92
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.013
Oh, I see.

93
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.830
That's because we have defaulted it to four here.

94
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.410
So maybe change that to two,

95
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.600
here we go.

96
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.700
August, Slick.

97
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.850
Okay, so that was really easy, right?

98
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.390
Now, let's actually get some,

99
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.780
links up and running so that

100
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.253
we can do next and previous.

101
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.043
And we'll do that in the next video.
