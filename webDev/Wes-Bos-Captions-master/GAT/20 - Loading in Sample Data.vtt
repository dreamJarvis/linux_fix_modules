00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.273
(soft chiming music)

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.340
<v Tutor>Working with toppings and pagination</v>

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.700
and dynamically creating pages.

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.080
And for that, we need lots and lots of content.

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.490
I'm not gonna make you sit here

6
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.270
and type in all the stupid names of the pizzas

7
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.103
that have created.

8
00:00:15.103 --> 00:00:18.300
So we are going to import it all directly into sanity.

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.020
If you like filling out forms, by all means,

10
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.550
please go ahead.

11
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.710
But if you take a look at the sanity folder,

12
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.750
so we're flipping back to the back end here,

13
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.700
sanity sample data.

14
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.550
And then in here, you see, we have a text data.

15
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.960
That's just the names of the pizzas

16
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.830
in case you need some sample data

17
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.170
but there's also this all-sample-data.gz

18
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.100
or z if y'all are American,

19
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.520
that is all of the pizzas.

20
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.960
The toppings, the slice masters and all of the images

21
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.610
and the relationships between all of them in one big file.

22
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.930
So we're going to import that directly into sanity.

23
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.270
So go to your sanity route

24
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.680
and the way that we run it,

25
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.260
is your on sanity dataset import.

26
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.230
And then we go to the actual folder.

27
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.770
So sample data,

28
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.930
you can also see into the sample data directory.

29
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.930
And then the file is called all-sample-data.gz.

30
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.990
Then we give it the data set we wanna inject it into,

31
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.150
because earlier we talked about having multiple data set.

32
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.550
In our case, we wanna do it into production.

33
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.750
And then there's optional, you'll see here,

34
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.740
I've run this before there's optionally a dash dash replace.

35
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.830
So if you're running this, like let's say,

36
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.970
you're working with sanity and you delete a bunch of stuff.

37
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.230
And are you modifying, like,

38
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.880
I just wanna go back to what West had.

39
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.810
You can rerun this command

40
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.490
with the dash dash replace command

41
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.010
and that will just overwrite anything on there.

42
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.140
So I've actually just run this just

43
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.360
before running this video.

44
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.260
So you'll see, I have them in there already.

45
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.900
So I'm gonna run it with the dash dash replace value.

46
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.600
You can run it with or without if it's your first time,

47
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.390
it doesn't matter either way.

48
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.730
So when you go ahead and run that,

49
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.170
it will import all the documents for us,

50
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.853
then it will upload all of the images to sanity.

51
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.750
And it's done, that was very quick.

52
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.670
Now, if we go here, I didn't even have to refresh the page.

53
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.020
It automatically show up.

54
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.570
All of our toppings will automatically show

55
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.920
up in here as well as all of our slice masters

56
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.820
will show up here, which is awesome.

57
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.760
So that is basic data.

58
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.150
I really liked that feature just because now we can get

59
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.403
into a working on our toppings filter and selector.

60
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.710
I stopped the video too soon.

61
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.360
I just went to try out

62
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.240
and see if the pizzas were showing up on the pizzas page.

63
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.150
I'm getting this error.

64
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.730
So I thought I'd take you along for debugging this error.

65
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.820
So cannot access property fluid,

66
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.750
pizza.image.asset is null.

67
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.860
So what that means is that we're trying

68
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.750
to say pizza.image.asset.fluid,

69
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.460
probably pizza.image doesn't exist.

70
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.520
So trying to go a little bit deeper doesn't work.

71
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.890
So that's probably like one of the pizzas

72
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.250
doesn't have an image

73
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.510
and we could go to our pizzas here

74
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.110
and scan it really quickly.

75
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.810
Looks like they all have the actual image.

76
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.670
One thing I would try first

77
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.660
before getting too deep into it just kill

78
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.533
the build and restart it.

79
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.860
And as that rebuilds, the other thing I would do is,

80
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.740
so this is obviously causing the issue.

81
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.070
So I would comment that out.

82
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.440
And then at the top of the single pizza,

83
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.203
I would cancel log pizza.image.

84
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.170
And actually I would also cancel pizza.name.

85
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.520
So I know which pizza we're referring to.

86
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.850
And then I would look over each of those

87
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.900
and see if this is ever undefined.

88
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.730
So let's see how this bill is going, refresh the page.

89
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.563
Oh!

90
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.920
Did that fix it? No, it didn't.

91
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.320
Cause I commented it out, okay?

92
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.763
So let's go and check our issue here.

93
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.860
They all seem to have it. Okay.

94
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.473
Let's put that back in.

95
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.410
Alright, this is working.

96
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.860
So all it was was just a restart that was needed.

97
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.030
I guess that happens because sanity pulls in the data.

98
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.820
Sometimes you have to restart Gatsby.

99
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.820
That's the long and hard of what we just learned here.

100
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.683
Alright and the next video,

101
00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:49.410
let's do a little bit more styling with some CSS grid

102
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.330
so we can get these showing up side by side.

103
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.950
I'm also going to show you something cool called sub grid.

104
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.200
So let's see in that one.
