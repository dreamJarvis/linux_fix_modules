00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.803
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.860
<v Instructor>Pagination component.</v>

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.720
We are going to make sort of a general,

4
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.060
use pagination component

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.008
because it's likely that you will use this

6
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:11.908
component for,

7
00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:15.570
I don't know if you have lots of different types of data on

8
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.520
a page, you want to be able to use reuse this over and over.

9
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.980
So go into our components folder and make a new file.

10
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.323
And we will call that pagination.js,

11
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.830
and we'll do our regular song and dance of importing react

12
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.013
from react,

13
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.683
export default pagination,

14
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.900
or I always forget the word function.

15
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.733
Here we go.

16
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.030
Now, that pagination let's actually return a div,

17
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.193
just say, P pagination,

18
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.173
we'll go into,

19
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.530
we'll go into our Slice Masters.js page.

20
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.333
And we'll go ahead and use that.

21
00:00:59.507 --> 00:01:02.320
So right here where we did this process, .env,

22
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.500
delete those and just put a pagination component in there

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.080
and then make sure you import, that pagination.

24
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.950
You see how this,

25
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.993
the errors here a little bit different,

26
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.830
that's because I changed

27
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.450
it to GATSBY-HOT-LOADER or fast refresh.

28
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.239
So if you're seeing that,

29
00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:23.330
if you see different kinds of low things, that's great.

30
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.910
And I believe one of the benefits to this

31
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.403
is that when , I save,

32
00:01:30.803 --> 00:01:32.420
it comes back from it.

33
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.730
So previously, if I broke the build,

34
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.250
like if I didn't import this pagination, and I used it,

35
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.117
it's broken and then, Oh, I forgot to import it.

36
00:01:42.117 --> 00:01:44.690
And then you give it a save and then you'd have to go like a

37
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.230
sucker and go hit the refresh button.

38
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.950
But with this, with this fast refresh,

39
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.480
it's good enough just to refresh it for you, which is great.

40
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.570
Okay. So we have imported our pagination component.

41
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.613
We have gone ahead and used it in here,

42
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.580
and then we are working in, in here right now.

43
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.230
So there's a couple pieces of information that need to be

44
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.760
passed in via Props. In order for the pagination to work,

45
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.760
we need a, how many per page? we need the total count.

46
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.200
We need the current page that we're on.

47
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.120
We need the skip value

48
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.640
and we need the base value.

49
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.253
And I'll show you what the base is in just a sec.

50
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.500
Then we need to, make some more variables,

51
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.450
make some variables.

52
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.197
So we'll say cons, total pages is equal to Math.ceil,

53
00:02:38.197 --> 00:02:42.420
and we could probably pass this value in, but whatever.

54
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.710
Well, let's calculate it again.

55
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.323
Total count divided by, per page.

56
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.150
Then we need some links for previous next and whether it has

57
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.142
a previous page and whether it doesn't have previous page,

58
00:02:57.142 --> 00:03:00.640
we'll get those in just a sec.

59
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.640
So first thing we need to do is to create some links for the

60
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.401
previous and next pages. So we'll go here.

61
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:11.610
We'll give ourselves a link.

62
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.210
We'll import that link from Gatsby.

63
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.070
Let's say link to is equal to now.

64
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.349
Normally you'd just say like Slice Masters. Oops, sorry.

65
00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.271
I got some curly brackets there.

66
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:26.930
Normally you just say like Slice Masters for slash and then

67
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.930
will interpolate the current page value in there.

68
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.440
But that then makes this not

69
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.380
flexible enough for other types

70
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.110
of content. So that's why we pass in this base value here.

71
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.370
And that will allow us to make this flexible.

72
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.843
So the base will be, like that.

73
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.977
And then the current page is going to be minus ,

74
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.380
minus one.

75
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.213
Okay.

76
00:03:57.213 --> 00:03:59.860
So let's stop there for just a second.

77
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.503
We need to go back to our Slice Masters.js,

78
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.470
and pass all that data into our pagination component.

79
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.870
So we'll go here and pagination,

80
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.533
what do we need per page?

81
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.833
Does he go to parse,

82
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.640
per page that comes in?

83
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.663
Where does that come in? Gatsby dash Node,

84
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.453
page size.

85
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.440
Yeah. See, I'm,

86
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.770
I'm mixing my words here per page and page size.

87
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.973
They're the same thing.

88
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.200
Let's stick with page size.

89
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.293
So let's, rename that per page to page size,

90
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.100
and let's go back to our pagination and rename that

91
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.370
to page size

92
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.963
here in here. Okay, cool.

93
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.450
The page size is the data is going to be coming in from the

94
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.720
page context.

95
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.690
So we need to restructure that page context again,

96
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.950
that page context variable, is all of the data that was

97
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.713
passed in right here.

98
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.723
So page size is page context. That page size,

99
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.023
the total count is equal to,

100
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:23.160
SliceMasters.totalcount.

101
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.663
Again, remember we created that right here.

102
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.440
The current page is equal to

103
00:05:34.814 --> 00:05:35.647
EVN

104
00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:36.520
page context

105
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.253
dot

106
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.220
current page

107
00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.030
and then one should say or one,

108
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.850
cause we might be on the first page and without the fourth

109
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.760
slash one on there,

110
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.360
our skip,

111
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.570
is page context

112
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.653
dot skip.

113
00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.080
And then finally our base is going to be a forward slash

114
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.373
Slice Masters.

115
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.200
Okay. So all that data is being piped in.

116
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.230
We'll go back to our pagination component here and we will

117
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.980
actually, we don't need the forward slash on this here.

118
00:06:13.725 --> 00:06:15.360
And we need a variable for the previous page.

119
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.512
Cause I don't like to do the math right inside of here.

120
00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:19.345
So we'll hear, say,

121
00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:24.010
const preview page is equal to the current page minus one.

122
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.640
And then we'll do the same thing for the next page.

123
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.043
That's just a current page plus one.

124
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.030
And we'll go here.

125
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.470
Link

126
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.841
is

127
00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:40.674
prev

128
00:06:40.674 --> 00:06:41.507
page,

129
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.330
and inside of that,

130
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.450
I'll just give myself a little arrow that says prev.

131
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.634
So this is just a Unicode arrow.

132
00:06:55.634 --> 00:06:56.670
If you don't know how to,

133
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.143
I have a little shortcut for those.

134
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.800
If you don't know how to get those,

135
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.340
just Google Unicode arrow,

136
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.060
and you'll be able to copy and paste it.

137
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.563
So we have our previous,

138
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.640
let's see, does that work?

139
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.383
So we'll go to Slice Masters four slash three,

140
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.096
and then if I click on it, it brings me to two.

141
00:07:20.096 --> 00:07:23.940
It brings me to one and then it goes to zero.

142
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.820
We'll have to we'll fix that in just a second. Okay.

143
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.373
Now duplicate that and we'll go to the next page.

144
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.063
Let's say,

145
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.303
next.

146
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.040
Okay, So we've got our previous and the next one.

147
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.400
It allows me to go back and forth.

148
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.503
I like it.

149
00:07:50.561 --> 00:07:53.937
Let's take care of the fact that you can ,

150
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.610
go to page six and page zero when they do not exist.

151
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.972
So we'll make some more variables here.

152
00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:03.780
So that const has next page is equal to,

153
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.740
if the next page,

154
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.410
is less or equal to the total pages ,

155
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.570
that is going to be true or false.

156
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.140
And then we'll do the same thing for has preview page.

157
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.140
And that is if the previous page is greater or equal to one,

158
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:25.380
that will tell us if we have a previous page,

159
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.870
and then we can go down to these links here.

160
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.263
I'll just say disabled.

161
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.383
Once you go to,

162
00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:38.790
bang has pre-phase and as next page.

163
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.090
So you could also conditionally show and hide,

164
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.940
these values, with react.

165
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.193
Like you could check if it's there or not,

166
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.550
but I don't like doing that because as soon as you hit a

167
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.520
page where there is no previous,

168
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.400
the whole pagination shifts,

169
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.310
so I'd rather just make it unclickable I'm in gray it out.

170
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.490
And we, these will still work to click ,

171
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.450
even like let's go to page one,

172
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.870
they watch I'm going to click it

173
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.070
like putting disabled on a, an anchor link.

174
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.623
Doesn't actually do anything,

175
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.610
that only works for buttons,

176
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.700
but I'm gonna show you how to actually make it work with

177
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.450
some CSS once we get to that. Okay.

178
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.340
So that's our previous and next buttons,

179
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.440
but we also need the like one, two, three, four, five

180
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.853
that goes in the middle.

181
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.810
So what we'll do is we'll go in between here.

182
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.910
We'll use our own little trick arrayed out from,

183
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.453
length of total pages.

184
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.440
And now we will map over it,

185
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.110
with the underscore I ,

186
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.830
see this is just like we did in our gets. We know,

187
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.980
but now we're doing it in a react template.

188
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.090
And for each one,

189
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.680
we overturn a link tag,

190
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.883
that has,

191
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.120
the I plus one,

192
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.083
inside of it.

193
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.320
Let's see if that works,

194
00:10:12.566 --> 00:10:14.540
that didn't work.

195
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.923
Why is it not showing up?

196
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.450
Maybe Gatsby needs it to have a, to value.

197
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.410
Otherwise it doesn't show up.

198
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.143
So let's just say link to,

199
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.180
and back ticks,

200
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.013
will say

201
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.470
the base,

202
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.597
Ford slash ,

203
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.410
I plus one.

204
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.610
Let's see if that works.

205
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.573
No nothing's showing up. Okay.

206
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.060
Y

207
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.740
let's depo this together right up from,

208
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.523
we have a length of 12 pages. And from each one we map,

209
00:11:03.978 --> 00:11:05.973
if I replaced this with just a paragraph that says, Hey,

210
00:11:08.411 --> 00:11:10.000
that doesn't show up. Okay.

211
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.993
Bring that back.

212
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.780
If I put some text here. Okay.

213
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.713
So our build is still working.

214
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.643
I believe, that this array is not,

215
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.750
being created,

216
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.640
right up from like the top pages.

217
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.050
So,

218
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.113
what I'll do,

219
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.620
is I'll put this in its own variable constant.

220
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.490
You don't have to do this. This is just me debugging.

221
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.913
I'll I'll bring it back and then console log that array.

222
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.690
Let's see if there's anything in there.

223
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.330
Yeah. Look at that.

224
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.593
Sucker sucker is empty.

225
00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:56.360
So I'm to console log total pages,

226
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.193
None.

227
00:12:02.176 --> 00:12:03.009
Okay.

228
00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:05.490
So that means our total pages value,

229
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.250
is not being correctly done.

230
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.403
So let's console log total count,

231
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.890
undefined.

232
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.793
Ah, so total count,

233
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.780
is not being passed in properly.

234
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.100
So our math is not working. So we'll go here.

235
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.943
Total count is equal to, ah,

236
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.560
you know why it's because ,

237
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.827
the total count ,

238
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.800
value is not on Nodes.

239
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.000
It's a level higher.

240
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.637
So what we need to do is go to our data total count here,

241
00:12:35.637 --> 00:12:40.630
and we'll say data.SliceMasters.totalcount.

242
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.260
There we go.

243
00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.093
Alright.

244
00:12:46.093 --> 00:12:47.330
So we're back up and running.

245
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.917
I'm going to bring this array ,

246
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:50.883
back,

247
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:53.483
here.

248
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.440
Now we've got one, two, three, four, five showing up.

249
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.540
One thing,

250
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.503
that I want is if I click on one,

251
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.930
I actually just want it to go to Ford slash Slice Masters,

252
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.490
not Ford slash Slice Masters four slash one.

253
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.953
So we can, we can fix that by going,

254
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.070
here, and I'll say,

255
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.523
if I is greater than zero.

256
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.230
So if it's one,

257
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.063
then,

258
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.250
we will return.

259
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.070
I plus one,

260
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.453
otherwise we returned just a blank string.

261
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.483
And if we click on one,

262
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.330
it goes to four slash Slice Masters.

263
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.993
But Oh it looks like,

264
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.640
our pagination is not showing up because total

265
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.400
pages is not anything.

266
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.420
And that's likely because,

267
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.493
the page size,

268
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.800
that's why, Cause our page size,

269
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.800
gets passed in via page context.

270
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.020
But when you go to Forrest slash Slice Masters,

271
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.020
this page is not being generated by Gatsby Node.

272
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.300
That page is being generated by simply just being in

273
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.960
page dot js.

274
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.123
So,

275
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.350
we let's modify this,

276
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:22.330
to,

277
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.660
be the old way.

278
00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.260
Parse env,

279
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.690
I'll say process,

280
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:27.973
dot env,

281
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.713
dot Gatsby underscore page on square size.

282
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.603
Gotta spell process. Right.

283
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:40.710
There we go. Okay.

284
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.590
That fixed it for us next, next, next.

285
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.423
Okay.

286
00:14:44.423 --> 00:14:47.430
So everything seems to be working

287
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.150
and now we just gotta slap

288
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.630
some CSS on it, so it doesn't look awful.

289
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.073
So let's go and make some pagination styled.

290
00:14:57.558 --> 00:14:59.740
So go back to our pagination.js.

291
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.480
We'll say const pagination styles is equal to styled,

292
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.000
dot div,

293
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.363
got an import style.

294
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.143
Ooh, that was wrong.

295
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.890
That one. Okay.

296
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.430
We'll display,

297
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.790
grid,

298
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.360
on that.

299
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.913
A grid.

300
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.590
We'll say align content,

301
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.620
center,

302
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.003
line items,

303
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.700
center,

304
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.173
justify items.

305
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.480
If you don't know how to center,

306
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.920
something and CSS grid just put all of them on

307
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.670
and you've probably, it might work.

308
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.393
Let's pop this pagination styles on the surrounding div.

309
00:15:45.928 --> 00:15:47.053
Here we go.

310
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.930
And that's wrong. This shouldn't have been grid.

311
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.173
This should be flex.

312
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.263
Yes. Okay.

313
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.530
We also want to pop a border one PX,

314
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.370
solid gray

315
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.183
margin to REM zero,

316
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.890
border radius,

317
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.290
five PX. Alright, so that is looking okay.

318
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.763
Then we'll grab each flex item. So we'll say,

319
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.117
and the direct descendant ,

320
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.163
on REM.

321
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.400
All right. All right.

322
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.033
I'll say flex one.

323
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.210
Boom.

324
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:38.163
I like it.

325
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.653
Margin zero.

326
00:16:42.091 --> 00:16:44.310
We don't need margin. Zero on that does nothing border.

327
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.630
Right?

328
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.270
One PX solid,

329
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.163
far dash dash gray.

330
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.073
Okay.

331
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.113
These are not centering themselves.

332
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.710
We didn't do a text line center on the parent.

333
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:07.790
Okay. Looking good.

334
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.170
Looking good on the actual links themselves.

335
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.110
We'll say text decoration, none.

336
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:15.210
Take that red off. Good.

337
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.133
And then we'll say,

338
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.820
any of these items.

339
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.850
So, and we're still inside of this direct descendant.

340
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.773
Anything that has an Aria,

341
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.740
dash current property,

342
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.800
or a class

343
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.253
of current on it,

344
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.590
then we will say color,

345
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:35.993
far, dash dash red.

346
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.723
And,

347
00:17:42.308 --> 00:17:45.060
here we go. One to see how this is working.

348
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.503
Or if we go to one page, one,

349
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.370
it's showing up.

350
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.890
But if we click on Slice Masters in the heading, this is,

351
00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.760
this is goofy. Look at that skin.

352
00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.210
Can you figure this one out,

353
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:02.040
click on one and then click on Slice Masters in the nav.

354
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.890
And it goes away.

355
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.370
And that is because of the trailing slash,

356
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.203
it's a bit of a

357
00:18:09.203 --> 00:18:10.170
weird thing with Gatsby link.

358
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.532
It doesn't totally match it up if there's a trailing slash.

359
00:18:13.532 --> 00:18:15.283
So to fix that,

360
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.293
we,

361
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.360
go back,

362
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.920
to our link here

363
00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.863
and we'll say class name is equal to curly brackets.

364
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.020
And it will say if the current page

365
00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.960
is equal to one,

366
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.130
and the index

367
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.543
is equal to zero,

368
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.800
then we'll give it a class of current.

369
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.240
Otherwise we give a class and nothing,

370
00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.066
and it's not turning red. Let's inspect it.

371
00:18:52.066 --> 00:18:54.093
Let's see the classes there.

372
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.583
What's wrong with our CSS.

373
00:18:59.187 --> 00:19:00.460
Oh,

374
00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.760
this seems to ampersand on it because it's not a child with

375
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.010
a current, it's the same element,

376
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.763
but also a class of current.

377
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.350
There we go. Okay.

378
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.830
So that's a little bit of weirdness around Gatsby link,

379
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.070
but we fixed it there.

380
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.400
Oh, next, next, next last thing is,

381
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.400
is if you are on page five and you want to click next,

382
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.560
you shouldn't be able to click that.

383
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.360
See how there's a disabled value on there.

384
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.453
So what we'll do,

385
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.180
is we'll say anything,

386
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.800
and

387
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.763
anything that has the disabled attribute,

388
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.430
then we'll say ,pointer

389
00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:42.700
events,

390
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.533
none.

391
00:19:43.533 --> 00:19:47.097
And that will make it not clickable or not keyboard

392
00:19:47.097 --> 00:19:48.647
navigatable.

393
00:19:48.647 --> 00:19:52.183
And then the color is going to be a gray color.

394
00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:55.803
There we go.

395
00:19:55.803 --> 00:19:58.500
And then what that does is you can't click it now and that's

396
00:19:59.476 --> 00:20:01.941
just a nice way to disable it. This should also happen.

397
00:20:01.941 --> 00:20:05.140
There we go on page one and if we go to Slice Masters,

398
00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.610
it's, unclickable beautiful.

399
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.710
So that's how we do pagination in,

400
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.700
Gatsby pretty straight

401
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.740
forward.

402
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:15.573
Well,

403
00:20:15.573 --> 00:20:17.650
last thing we need to do and I'll save this for the next

404
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:21.320
video, but that is when you click on an actual Slice master

405
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.153
themselves,

406
00:20:22.153 --> 00:20:24.600
we should be able to see them as well as their bio.
