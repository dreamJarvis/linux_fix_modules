<v ->Hey folks!</v>

3
00:00:01.863 --> 00:00:02.730
Wes Bos here, thanks so much

4
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.510
for checking out my latest course: Master Gatsby!

5
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.270
Gatsby is a framework for building websites with React JS

6
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.228
that makes all the tough parts

7
00:00:11.228 --> 00:00:13.740
of modern websites really easy,

8
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.210
so things like preloading and routing,

9
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.170
compression, critical CSS, what else?

10
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.210
Caching, scaling, bundlers,

11
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.690
all of these things are tough,

12
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.410
which means they don't necessarily always get added

13
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.270
to our websites,

14
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.440
but with Gatsby they happen automatically,

15
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.630
so we can stick to building awesome websites.

16
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.570
So in this course we're building Slick's Slices,

17
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.480
it's a pizza website

18
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.900
that includes all of the parts and pieces,

19
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.900
so you're gonna learn about all of the different pieces

20
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.843
of building a modern website,

21
00:00:40.843 --> 00:00:43.420
including, what do we got here,

22
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.420
GraphQL, React JS, hooks, custom hooks using a headless CMS,

23
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.180
progressive images, scoped CSS, serverless functions,

24
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.980
sending email, all kinds of really good stuff,

25
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.060
so hopefully you're gonna enjoy this one,

26
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.977
and I will catch you in the course.
