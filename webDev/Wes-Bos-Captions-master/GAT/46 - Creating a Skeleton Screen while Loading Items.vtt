1
00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:02.665
(soft music)

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.690
<v Instructor>Alright, let's get working on these,</v>

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.810
and we're gonna need, I dunno,

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.970
several grids to get this to work.

5
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.210
And when I'm working with several grids,

6
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.040
I like to maybe just stick them into their own grids file,

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.040
just so that I know that all of my layout grids

8
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.720
are in a single file.

9
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.310
So let's go into our styles folder here,

10
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.683
create a new file and call that Grids.js,

11
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.870
and what we'll do in here

12
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.920
is we'll make a grid called home page grid.

13
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.603
So we'll say export const,

14
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.040
home page grid is equal to Styled.div,

15
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.373
and we'll have to import styled.

16
00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:46.957
There we go, and in here we'll display grid,

17
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.330
grid gap, actually just gap now is 20 PX,

18
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.743
grid template columns.

19
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.123
Repeat.

20
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.240
Two, min max,

21
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.723
auto one FR.

22
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.050
I believe that's what we need.

23
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.020
Then we'll go back to our home page,

24
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.650
and go ahead and use that.

25
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.410
So we'll find our home page here,

26
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.310
and see this div right here?

27
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.820
That needs to be swapped out with our actual grid.

28
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.760
So we'll say home page grid.

29
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.650
Make sure that your closing tag is also renamed that,

30
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.650
and then we'll give that an import.

31
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.860
Make sure that that imported it from there.

32
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.680
Good. Okay.

33
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.163
That's not what we wanted.

34
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.160
That's not what I wanted.

35
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.140
The home page grid is not there.

36
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.513
It is right here.

37
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.143
Home page grid.

38
00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:47.462
There we go.

39
00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:48.700
Currently slicing and hot slices.

40
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.820
Okay, cool.

41
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.880
Next up, I think I'm gonna do the loading state first.

42
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.550
So because the fact that it loads,

43
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.960
once you, you actually load the page, like watch here.

44
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.450
We need something to like put there

45
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.300
just to show that something is happening

46
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.520
before it goes ahead.

47
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.520
So what we'll do is we'll go back into our grids,

48
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.993
and we'll make a new one.

49
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.660
Export const, we'll call it items grid.

50
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.153
That's equal to Styled.div.

51
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.840
We will display grid on it.

52
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.293
Gap, two REM,

53
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.070
and grid template columns.

54
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.260
One FR and one FR.

55
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.270
Actually, I'm just looking at this right here.

56
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.270
This is two REM, and this is almost the same thing.

57
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.570
We could put a variable in there and swap it out,

58
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.470
but honestly, it's three lines of CSS, who cares?

59
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.630
It's fine to do it that way,

60
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.720
but if things start to look the same,

61
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.010
like, hmm, maybe I can make some sort

62
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.240
of reusable grid component here

63
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.370
and then pass in the number of columns and whatnot.

64
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.020
I actually initially did do that,

65
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.300
but I was running into trouble with

66
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.290
like nesting grids inside of grids.

67
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.420
So I just decided to go for very

68
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.370
explicit grids that we have there.

69
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.500
Next we're gonna make a loading grid.

70
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.840
And I think that will be its own component.

71
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.950
So let's go into our components, make a new file,

72
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.613
we'll call it LoadingGrid.js,

73
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.330
and we'll export default, function, loading grid.

74
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.730
And that takes in a prop,

75
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.900
which is a count of number of loader items to show,

76
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.543
and then inside of that, we will return,

77
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.000
return, our items grid

78
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.080
that we just made.

79
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.253
That should be auto imported from our CSS.

80
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.990
Why is my auto import not working anymore?

81
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.823
Come on now.

82
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.380
Oh, well we can, we can import it like the olden days again.

83
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.390
Import, items grid,

84
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.280
from, go up a level,

85
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.573
go into styles and grab that from grids.

86
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.600
And then inside of this, we are going to have,

87
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.233
let's just do P loading four times.

88
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.231
Okay.

89
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:20.330
And then we will, let's just get

90
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.700
this rendering out on the page.

91
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.570
So hop back to your, your home page,

92
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.920
where we have currently slicing and hot slices,

93
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.450
and let's just replace both of those

94
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.450
with loading grid and auto import that.

95
00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:39.684
There we go.

96
00:04:39.684 --> 00:04:41.017
That one worked.

97
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.130
React is not defined.

98
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.170
Oh yeah. We forgot to do that.

99
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.273
Import, react from react.

100
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.853
Okay, cool.

101
00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:53.230
So now we have obviously our loading grid showing up.

102
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.130
One, two, three, four.

103
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.820
We've got our four items showing up.

104
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.880
We'll go back to our loading grid here now,

105
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.110
and we'll take however many items are being passed in.

106
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.080
So when we use it, we'll have to pass in a count of,

107
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.130
in our case, we're gonna pass it in four,

108
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.550
and we'll loop over that many, that many times.

109
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.440
So curly brackets, Array.from.

110
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.060
So we're gonna make an array of four empty spots,

111
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.730
and the length of that array is going to be

112
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.233
however many are passed in.

113
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.030
And the kind of cool thing about Array.from

114
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.170
is a second argument of Array.from is a map function.

115
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.120
So we could either just tag a .map onto the end here

116
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.270
and fill those up with empty items,

117
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.410
or in our case, we,

118
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.380
the second argument of array from is also a map function.

119
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.330
So first argument we don't need.

120
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.650
So we just put an underscore there

121
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.360
so we can get at a second argument,

122
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.290
which is the index and have that there,

123
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.510
and I'm going to use parenthesis

124
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.113
so it's an implicit return,

125
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.620
and then for each one of those,

126
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.470
let's just pay loading dot, dot, dot.

127
00:06:07.913 --> 00:06:08.746
Okay.

128
00:06:08.746 --> 00:06:11.930
So the exact same thing happened except now in our case,

129
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.860
we could change the number of loading items,

130
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.883
and it would just immediately change for us.

131
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.040
But what we need to do inside of here

132
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.720
is we need a div inside of that.

133
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.520
We need a paragraph with the class of mark,

134
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.320
and we'll say loading dot, dot, dot.

135
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.653
Okay. That looks good.

136
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.130
Then we also need an image

137
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.100
where the class name is equal to loading.

138
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.450
The alt is equal to, I think, Oh, that's a good question.

139
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.123
Do you need to put an alt on a loading indicator image,

140
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.170
or can you omit that, or can you like,

141
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.690
does a screen reader need to know that it's loading?

142
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.193
Probably. Let's leave it on.

143
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.210
We'll say width of 500,

144
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.133
a height of 400,

145
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.110
and I believe we'll also need a source

146
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.800
because even though we gave it a width and a height,

147
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.980
this will actually change in CSS pretty soon.

148
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.840
I think this might already be in Chrome,

149
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.620
but if you give something a width and a height it should,

150
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.540
even if the source is not loaded yet,

151
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.320
it should at least maintain that aspect ratio.

152
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.153
So,

153
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.620
you're gonna have to grab this

154
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.360
from the LoadingGrid.js final answer

155
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.310
because I'm not expecting you to type that,

156
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.370
but I have this right here, and all that is,

157
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.050
is a blank image that has a ratio

158
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.490
of five pixels wide and four pixels high.

159
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.490
And what that allows me to do is to maintain a ratio.

160
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.103
There we go.

161
00:07:58.103 --> 00:07:59.050
See?

162
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.110
If you hover over top of it, five by four.

163
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.490
It's just transparent,

164
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.620
and that allows us to stick with a ratio.

165
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.300
So even though this image hasn't been loaded yet,

166
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.700
it will still give us the size that we want.

167
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.000
They are a little bit tall.

168
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.220
We'll fix that in CSS.

169
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.360
And then we're also gonna add

170
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.830
this little animation right here,

171
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.300
this little animation that goes there.

172
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.133
So.

173
00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:21.050
So let's jump back into our grids JS,

174
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.460
and we'll also put the styles

175
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.640
for a single grid item in here.

176
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.093
Single grid item. We'll say for home page.

177
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.073
And we'll say const item is equal to Styled.div.

178
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.793
And let's just say background red.

179
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.620
And we'll go back to our loading grid

180
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.500
and swap out this div here with an item.

181
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.020
Oh, sorry. That should be item styles.

182
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.000
Item styles, and we'll also put an export in front of that.

183
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.223
I'll go into our loading grid and say item styles.

184
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.873
It's not importing, but we can grab it from here.

185
00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:04.652
There we go.

186
00:09:04.652 --> 00:09:07.670
So now at least know that this CSS is working.

187
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.190
And then we'll just write a whole bunch

188
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.370
of CSS here to make it look how we want.

189
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.030
So start off with a text align center

190
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.903
and a position relative.

191
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.800
I'll grab the image that is in there,

192
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.170
and I'm gonna put a border on it.

193
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.003
One PX, solid red.

194
00:09:25.003 --> 00:09:28.100
Just so you can see where that image is.

195
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:28.933
See?

196
00:09:28.933 --> 00:09:30.110
See it there.

197
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.043
We'll say the height is auto.

198
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:33.743
There we go.

199
00:09:33.743 --> 00:09:36.220
Now they're showing up properly.

200
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:41.220
The font size is zero, and that doesn't seem to do anything.

201
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.590
Usually when I do that, it's because an image

202
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.190
will have what's called ghost space.

203
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.440
If you put two inline elements beside each other,

204
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.300
which images inline block,

205
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.130
then you'll have this just like spacing between them,

206
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.480
which is not margin or padding a border or anything.

207
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.540
It's just a national space that CSS gives you.

208
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.700
And the size of that space is determined by the font size.

209
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.890
So usually I pop a font size zero on there

210
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.550
if I'm running into some weird issues with that.

211
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.860
Let's grab the paragraph tag.

212
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.640
We'll say transform,

213
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.080
rotate negative two degrees, and translate.

214
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.073
Let's just see what that does like that.

215
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:25.953
It. . .

216
00:10:25.953 --> 00:10:28.400
We are also gonna put a position absolute on it

217
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.640
so it can go over top.

218
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.473
Good,

219
00:10:30.473 --> 00:10:32.630
and then I want it to be centered.

220
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.260
So we'll say transform, or no, translate,

221
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.060
Y negative 50%,

222
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.090
and we'll give it a width of 100%.

223
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.350
I know it didn't do anything, but hold on for a second.

224
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.183
There we go.

225
00:10:46.183 --> 00:10:47.700
Width of 100%.

226
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.630
Left zero, and then we will take the mark

227
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.390
that is inside of it and say display inline.

228
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.993
Do we put a Mark inside of it?

229
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.030
No. Okay.

230
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.120
We goofed that up.

231
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.140
Let's go back to our loading grid here

232
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.780
and not give a class of mark to this.

233
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.780
We're gonna put a span with a class of mark inside of it.

234
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.240
Boom. There we go.

235
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.150
That's looking pretty good.

236
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.113
Okay, we can take the border off of that.

237
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:28.023
And now we'll grab the image when it has a class of loading,

238
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.830
and we'll set a couple of variables here.

239
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.083
We will need a shine variable,

240
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.163
which is going be the color white,

241
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.113
and the background variable,

242
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.030
which is going to be just my gray variable

243
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:50.860
that we've had before,

244
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.690
and then we're going to put a gradient on it.

245
00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:59.690
So say background image is a linear gradient

246
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.410
that is 90 degrees, and. . .

247
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.500
Or have a variable, gray, or no,

248
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.640
not gray, background

249
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.610
that is zero PX.

250
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.210
Then we have another variable,

251
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.070
which is the shine that goes for 40 PX.

252
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.623
Oh, don't put a comma there.

253
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.390
And then finally, we'll go back to gray.

254
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:33.390
So variable, background is at 80 PX.

255
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.210
We'll see where that gets us.

256
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.300
So backward image, linear gradient, 90 degrees.

257
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.733
We go from this background color,

258
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.033
back to shine, back to background,

259
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.160
and that's not showing up.

260
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.173
Let's try to change that to red.

261
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.500
Okay, now let's try put a background size of 500 PX on it.

262
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.493
Width a 100%.

263
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.040
Alright. That's not showing up.

264
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.963
Let's inspect that element here.

265
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.260
Oh, look at that.

266
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.923
Capital L on my loading. That's why.

267
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.900
Oh, there it is. Now I'll take lower case.

268
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.493
There we go. All right.

269
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.100
Now you see what's happening here

270
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.240
is that we just set the background of this gradient to be,

271
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.230
we're gonna start at red.

272
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.530
Then at 40 pixels, we'll go to white,

273
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.780
and then we add after 80 pixels,

274
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.640
we'll go back to the red color.

275
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.190
And then we can just change this to be any other color.

276
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.880
Well, I'm gonna use the gray variable

277
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.108
that we've used since the start.

278
00:13:54.108 --> 00:13:55.170
There we go.

279
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.310
And now we want to animate it, right?

280
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.220
So we'll pop an animation on it.

281
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.030
Animation.

282
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.470
We'll say shine over one second.

283
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.940
We want it to infinitely animate,

284
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.610
and we want it to be linear,

285
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.053
and then we'll have to go and write this shine animation.

286
00:14:14.116 --> 00:14:16.210
We can actually do it right above here.

287
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.830
If you were reusing this, you could put it in its own file,

288
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.810
but in our case, we're just using it here.

289
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.710
Say at @keyframes, shine, we want to go from background.

290
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.243
From is a curly bracket.

291
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.330
Background position 200%.

292
00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.960
So we want to basically, we're just gonna move

293
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.500
where the background is positioned,

294
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.810
and then we want to go to

295
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.883
background position,

296
00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.970
negative 40 PX, and that will,

297
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.900
that negative 40 PX lines up with this,

298
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.410
and that will, sorry I gotta put PX,

299
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.480
put that shine off the screen.

300
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.760
There we go.

301
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.795
Woo.

302
00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:06.726
Woo.

303
00:15:06.726 --> 00:15:07.670
Woo.

304
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.260
And you can play with different values of this.

305
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.503
Like you could do this 25 degrees.

306
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.090
That actually doesn't look very good.

307
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.150
Zero degrees. It'll go from top to bottom.

308
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.640
If that was the case, you'd need to change

309
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.450
the axes of the background position.

310
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.490
So that's not a really good example,

311
00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.210
but we'll put that back to 90 degrees.

312
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.000
Of course you could change the color

313
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.260
and everything else that you have there.

314
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.880
So that is our loading items that are showing up.

315
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.650
Well, we now need to do is conditionally show

316
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.960
these loading items while we are in a loading state.

317
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.920
So go back to our index here,

318
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.700
and let's go into currently slicing,

319
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.700
and currently slicing takes in the slice masters.

320
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.730
So we'll say, we'll destructure that.

321
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.063
Slice masters.

322
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.113
And in here, we'll say if there are no slice masters,

323
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.340
then we'll do, and, and.

324
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.240
We'll put the loading grid in there.

325
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.210
And then we also have to take care of the fact

326
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.050
that maybe there are slice masters array, but it's empty.

327
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.770
So we'll say slice masters if there are slice masters,

328
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:30.950
but there is not SliceMasters.length.

329
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.810
And we can put a question mark on there to make sure

330
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.560
there are slice masters before we access length.

331
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.620
Otherwise, if it's the case where there is nothing,

332
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.810
then, it will say cannot access

333
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.503
property length of undefined.

334
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:50.360
If that is the case, then we say, and, and again,

335
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.023
just a paragraph that says no one is working right now.

336
00:16:59.020 --> 00:16:59.903
Now watch this.

337
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.253
Loading, loading, loading.

338
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.890
And once the slice masters come back. . .

339
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.320
Hold on, let's console log the slice masters

340
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.670
and see what we have there.

341
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:10.950
So see, we've got loading now,

342
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.540
and then boom, once the slice masters come back,

343
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.000
then we don't see anything.

344
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.350
And that's where we'd have to loop over

345
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:20.130
and actually display those items.

346
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.350
So let's do that for the other thing on the home page.

347
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.280
So we'll go to our hot slices.

348
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.573
We'll destructure the hot slices.

349
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.500
And in here, we'll say if there are no hot slices,

350
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.610
and we'll give ourself a loading grid.

351
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.473
If there are. . .

352
00:17:46.473 --> 00:17:48.020
We can pretty much just take this

353
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.940
whole thing right here and duplicate it.

354
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.073
So change out slice masters to hot slices.

355
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.690
Let's say

356
00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.283
nothing in the case.

357
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.330
And you can verify that by going

358
00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.680
into your sanity, backend, deleting everything.

359
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.650
That's good.

360
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.990
And then the final thing we need to do

361
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.010
is to loop over and display all of the actual items,

362
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.600
but I think we've done enough in this video.

363
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.790
Let's pause right there and make sure

364
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.550
everyone's caught up as to what we have.

365
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.600
And we'll pick that up in the next video.
