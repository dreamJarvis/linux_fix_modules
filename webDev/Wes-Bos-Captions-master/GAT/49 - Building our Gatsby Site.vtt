00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.583
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.730
<v ->Talk about building our Gatsby website.</v>

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.130
So, at the end of the day

4
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.170
Gatsby is just a static site generator.

5
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.720
So, it will kick out HTML,

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.830
CSS and JavaScript in order to generate that JavaScript

7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.530
because everything we've been doing so far

8
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.960
has just been in development mode.

9
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.850
But at the end of the day you need to kick it out.

10
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.420
So, in order to do that, you run npm run build,

11
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.100
which in turn is going to run Gatsby build,

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.160
but that will also include some of the stuff

13
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.100
so we can use ES modules.

14
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.860
And this will take anywhere from, I don't know,

15
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.700
15-20 seconds up till I've had some sites

16
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.650
that were 15 minutes or something like that.

17
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.750
And the really big kicker is if you have images

18
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.820
that need to be resized on build time,

19
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.290
that is what really ends up giving you a lot of time.

20
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.640
If you've got my personal westboss.com,

21
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.120
it takes about 11-12-15 minutes to build.

22
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.770
And I've got, I don't know 500 images each

23
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.200
with a couple different sizes each.

24
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.520
So that can get up there.

25
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.240
But luckily, if you're using Sanity or any other

26
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.660
sort of image hosting service,

27
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.330
they do the resizing on their servers.

28
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.040
So you don't actually have to worry about that.

29
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.180
So that is the case for Sanity here.

30
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.190
Looks like I just ran up on an issue here,

31
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.283
order provider is not defined.

32
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.293
And that's happening on ground beef.

33
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.840
Okay, so what I'm gonna do

34
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.690
is open up my Gatsby site, and I'm going

35
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.023
to look at Gatsby SSR.

36
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.600
And, okay,

37
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.890
we've got our aha, here we go,

38
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.690
that it's right here.

39
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.773
So we open up our Gatsby browser.

40
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.230
You see that we have this wrap root element

41
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.790
where we just wrapped the root element

42
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.170
in our order provider,

43
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.170
and then we wrap the root element ,

44
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.710
and that happens in the browser.

45
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.680
But when you're doing a build,

46
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.400
it doesn't use Gatsby browser.

47
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.690
It does use that in the browser,

48
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.340
but it also uses Gatsby SSR

49
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.600
when it's generating HTML.

50
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.570
Looks like, this needs to be imported.

51
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.010
So if you don't have the issue,

52
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.400
it's because I also updated the the finished files.

53
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.130
But I thought I'd show you how to fix that.

54
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.820
And I bet now if we've run NPM,

55
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.163
run build again, it will now work.

56
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.170
Boom! Looks like it's done all of this garbage in here.

57
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.290
That's just because we've got console logs

58
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.280
and our Gatsby node,

59
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.230
you take those out.

60
00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:27.946
So it doesn't show up.

61
00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:28.860
Now, if we open this sucker up,

62
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.860
you will see in our Gatsby folder,

63
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.743
we have a public folder and look at this!

64
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.750
This is literally all of the pages

65
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.730
and everything that we need.

66
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.700
So, if you take a look,

67
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.560
here's our index HTML,

68
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.610
you can open that up and (chuckles) look,

69
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.363
it actually kind of works.

70
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.860
If you open it up on a file,

71
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.390
not all the URLs are going to resolve.

72
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.610
It does definitely still has to be

73
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.900
on a domain name, but look,

74
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.960
it's still kind of works (chuckles).

75
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.370
I like the URL like that

76
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.670
or the the font like that it's kinda funny.

77
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.410
But you see that every single page

78
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.910
that we have like Ford/pizza,

79
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.330
Ford/Jimi Hendrix, Ford/index HTML.

80
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.130
So, this is just like the olden days of HTML

81
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.860
and that we're just using folders to do all of our routing

82
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.330
and see that all of the URLs are in here.

83
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.110
So, that's how you build a Gatsby website.

84
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.390
Everything is sort of being kicked out there,

85
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.230
and then hosting the sucker.

86
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.630
We've got a couple different options

87
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.653
and we'll go into those in the next video.
