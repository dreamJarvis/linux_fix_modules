00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:03.086
(ethereal music)

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.140
<v Wes>All right, let's talk about styles in CSS.</v>

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.890
So now that we've got this layout here,

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.700
you might be thinking, okay, where's styles?

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.650
No problem, pop a link tag in there, give it a relative path

6
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.800
to my CSS file and we'll call it a day.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.820
However, that would actually work,

8
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.820
but it goes against the idea of Gatsby, in that Gatsby needs

9
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.920
to know about everything in your project.

10
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.390
It needs to know about your data, your images,

11
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.790
your pages, your links,

12
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.240
and it needs to know about your CSS, why?

13
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.190
Because like, I don't know, if we go to wesbos.com

14
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.850
and we were to view Page Source here,

15
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.060
you'll see that all of the CSS that is being dumped

16
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.850
in here is being dumped before any of the content.

17
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.750
And that's because Gatsby has figured out what CSS

18
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.120
that I've written for this website is necessary

19
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.560
is what's called the Critical CSS

20
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.360
in order for that page to render

21
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.360
without having a big sort of a flash of unstyled text.

22
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.900
So instead of just linking to it like this,

23
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.060
because that goes outside of Gatsby,

24
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.250
we need to import it through Gatsby.

25
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.230
Now, there's a whole bunch of different ways

26
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.440
that you can do CSS in Gatsby.

27
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.070
And we are eventually going to just land

28
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.060
on using styled-components.

29
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.170
But I'm gonna show you just a couple of ways

30
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.003
that you could do it.

31
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.830
So, certainly, you could go into your styles folder,

32
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.910
and let's just make like a red.css.

33
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.810
And inside of that, let's just say,

34
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.810
body is background is red.

35
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.990
Then what you can do is you go into your gatsby-browser.js

36
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.080
and simply just import that right in.

37
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.170
So, we just say import, what is it?

38
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.170
It's in our source folder, that's in our styles folder,

39
00:01:57.347 --> 00:01:59.580
and then it's red.css.

40
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.530
Give that a save.

41
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.690
And now we go to this page.

42
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.140
The background is obviously red.

43
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.080
And what's important about that is that Gatsby will know

44
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.940
that this is necessary in order to make that first render

45
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.330
and it will stick it.

46
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.420
If you view Page Source on this, you're not gonna see it.

47
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.190
And that's because we're in development mode.

48
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.130
But if you were to run a Gatsby build

49
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.900
which we will be doing in just a bit, you would see that

50
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.820
it would stick that into a style tag right on the page.

51
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.350
So that's one way.

52
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.500
Another way is Gatsby in the docs, they show you

53
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.233
how to use this CSS modules,

54
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.050
which I'll let you go into the docs and read it.

55
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.020
I don't need another tutorial saying exactly

56
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.410
what is in the documentation.

57
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.750
It's not my favorite.

58
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.240
I feel like it's like a little bit clunky.

59
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.150
One thing I like to use is called styled-components.

60
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.150
And this is just a way to do scope CSS

61
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.800
inside of React application.

62
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.920
And I actually use it in my own personal website

63
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.200
and a lot of my other courses.

64
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.290
And I'm a big fan of it.

65
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.070
So that is to say, I don't actually use a whole lot

66
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.540
of the special styled-component stuff,

67
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.540
I use it mostly for the ability to scope my CSS

68
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.280
and make reusable styled-components.

69
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.210
So the first thing that we need to do is

70
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.830
to set some global styles in our application.

71
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.850
And the second thing we're gonna do

72
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.250
is to create some typography styles

73
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.500
and then we'll get into writing the CSS

74
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.830
throughout the entire course.

75
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.700
And usually in my courses, I don't include writing all

76
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.820
of the CSS just because it would take forever,

77
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.610
but in this course, part of it,

78
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.500
I'm just gonna tell you to go grab it.

79
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.720
And then other parts that are interesting

80
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.590
in terms of like neat layout, tricks, and whatnot,

81
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.680
I'm gonna code it with you.

82
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.910
And if you're totally not interested in writing CSS with me,

83
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.870
you can just go grab it from the finished-file.

84
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.160
So what we need to do first is to set up some

85
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.420
of our global styles, because on any website,

86
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.610
oh, I got to get rid of this red.css, it's too much.

87
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.993
I already did, did I?

88
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.423
Gatsby-browser. No, I didn't.

89
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.920
All right, well, what was I saying?

90
00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.900
On any website, you're gonna have global styles,

91
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.240
things like what color is the background?

92
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.410
What are the different fonts?

93
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.100
What do buttons look like?

94
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.860
What do the scroll bars look like?

95
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.610
Is there any max-width on the images?

96
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.900
There's a whole bunch of stuff that you want,

97
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.460
sorta just globally applied on your website.

98
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.190
So global styles, what are things?

99
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.380
If we take a look at this website,

100
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.300
we've got this kind of background pattern here,

101
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.020
we've got the specific black, that specific yellow,

102
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.990
that specific red, things like, if we go to them,

103
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.990
if we see text, how big is that text,

104
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.220
things like how big are the images at their maximum.

105
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.490
Those are all things that need

106
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.380
to be in our global styles initially,

107
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.720
because it doesn't make a lot of sense to have

108
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.590
to reset those every single time that we make a component.

109
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.900
And if you're not sure what a scope style is,

110
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.930
it'll make a whole lot of sense when we start to make it.

111
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.150
So, first thing we need to do

112
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.530
is just reset our entire application,

113
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.760
because by default, all the browsers have a bit

114
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.310
of a different baseline.

115
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.690
And a package that I use

116
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.440 line:15% 
to just reset everything is called normalize.css.

117
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.160 line:15% 
I guess the reset is not a good word,

118
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.220 line:15% 
it normalizes all of the browsers so that you're starting

119
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.170
with the exact same foundation on every single one.

120
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.280
So, simply just go into your Layout.js, and at the top,

121
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.580
we're just gonna import 'normalize.css'.

122
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.740
And you're gonna say to yourself, like, look,

123
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.913
if I comment that out,

124
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.020
you see how there's like this itty-bitty,

125
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.520
tiny little border around.

126
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.000
I think it's the HTML lets the body.

127
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.330
So, if I hover over the body,

128
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.610
there's like a random margin around the body,

129
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.050
like what's the point of that?

130
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.300
So by including normalize.css, you see how that goes away.

131
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.913
And now if I were to inspect my body,

132
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.840
you'll see it applies a margin zero.

133
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.240
So just little things like that.

134
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.887
Nice little base importing.

135
00:06:21.887 --> 00:06:22.720
And you might say like,

136
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.517
"Wes, I don't see that CSS file anywhere.

137
00:06:25.517 --> 00:06:27.407
"Like where is normalize.css?"

138
00:06:27.407 --> 00:06:28.990
And it's actually a package.

139
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.360
If you open package JSON, you'll see it,

140
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.700
in here that I've installed it for you.

141
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.310
And it's actually just including the package,

142
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.610
which in turn will give you the CSS.

143
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.830
All right, next, what we need to do

144
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.640
is to make some global style.

145
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.480
So let's go into our styles directory here

146
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.480 line:15% 
and let's create a file called GlobalStyles.js.

147
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.880 line:15% 
It's not CSS in this case.

148
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.210 line:15% 
And that's because we're

149
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.440
using a package called styled-components, which allows us

150
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.870
to create reusable styles over and over again.

151
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.940
So, inside of this global styles,

152
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.180
I'm actually gonna just gonna get you to copy

153
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.530
and paste it from the finished-files, why?

154
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.160
Because it's not all that interesting.

155
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.460
It's just a some boilerplate for the stuff.

156
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.860
That's a lot more interesting

157
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.910
in terms of like how we lay this stuff out.

158
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.160
I'll go through that with you.

159
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.200
So go to the finished-files that we have here

160
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.303
in our Gatsby folder and then in our source folder,

161
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.270
in our styles folder, and then find your global styles.

162
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.450
Instead of just copy pasting it here,

163
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.660
I just like to click Raw, copy, and then paste it into here.

164
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.830
So let's go through what's going on in here.

165
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.000
So, we've got our createGlobalStyle.

166
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.390
This is a function from our styled-components library,

167
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.110
which is something that I've installed for you.

168
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.830
Then, this is kind of interesting.

169
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.350
So you don't see this really all that often.

170
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.350
Like, I'm importing SVGs inside of JavaScript.

171
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.150
And like over here, you're importing CSS

172
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.370
inside of JavaScript.

173
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.660
Like I'm pretty sure that's not valid JavaScript.

174
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.493
And it's not.

175
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:17.210
It's not valid JavaScript, but because the way

176
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.500
that Gatsby works is that Gatsby allows you

177
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.090
to import anything, including images in CSS,

178
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.920
and then Gatsby knows not to actually render that out

179
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.783
to JavaScript, but it knows to render that out to CSS

180
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.710
or to a compressed image or something like that.

181
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.710
So I'm importing these right here.

182
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.610
And the reason I'm not just sticking them

183
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:44.050
in my assets folder and referencing from there is because

184
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.460
if I were just to reference them in here,

185
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.870
then that would have to go in the static folder,

186
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.440
and Gatsby doesn't know about it.

187
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.150
So I'll show you what this renders out to

188
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.563
in just a quick second.

189
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.640
Then I have some variables.

190
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.780
So these are just regular old CSS variables

191
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.090
or they're called custom properties.

192
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.100
And the reason why I put them on the root

193
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.870
is so that they are available anywhere I want

194
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.930
through the application.

195
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.193
So I use this red, black, yellow pretty frequently.

196
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.053
Then we have our base styles for HTML and our body.

197
00:09:19.185 --> 00:09:22.570
I have some base styles for fieldsets.

198
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.110
Some base styles for all of our buttons in here.

199
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.230
Some people like to create reusable buttons

200
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.920
over and over again, but I just like to use a regular button

201
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.630
and style it the same way for the entire application.

202
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.630
This, right here, is how I select the Gatsby images

203
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.050
before they are fully rendered.

204
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:48.740
So, if we take a look at this right here and I refresh,

205
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.180
actually, no, that's a bad example.

206
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.460
If we go to the pizza, so there we go,

207
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.730
you see that the pizza's, right here,

208
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.560
what Gatsby actually does under the hood,

209
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.690
I take a drink every time I say under the hood

210
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.523
in this course.

211
00:10:01.523 --> 00:10:03.550
I'm sorry if I overuse it.

212
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.880
Gatsby actually renders out their images

213
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.490
with all kinds of really neat things.

214
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:13.490
They render out image with multiple formats.

215
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.760
So this is WebP.

216
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.040
This is a format that works in, I think,

217
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.263
Chrome, Firefox, not Safari.

218
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.220
I don't know, it works in some browsers, not all of them,

219
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.870
but it will fall back to other versions if it doesn't.

220
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.570
And then it also ships multiple sizes of that image.

221
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.710
So based on the size of the user's device,

222
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.640
it will load larger or smaller versions,

223
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.890
which is really cool.

224
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.670
And then one more neat thing that it does

225
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:48.670
is when you load up the image for the first time

226
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.150
before any of these images have finished downloading

227
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.730
from the server, it actually just renders

228
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.410
out this Base64 string.

229
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.750
And this is really cool because instead of having

230
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.540
to wait for a small thumbnail version,

231
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.740
it just ships that image as text

232
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.660
in something called Base64.

233
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.470
So if I were to copy this and paste this Base64 in here,

234
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.470
this is a pizza with pear on it.

235
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:26.200
That's a bit odd, pear and potato, but that image is,

236
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.470
if you were just to paste that into your browser,

237
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.390
I think, yeah, look, look, it's tiny.

238
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.970
It's 20 by 20 pixels.

239
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.700
Absolutely tiny, but the idea is that you can blur,

240
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.680
you can scale up that image really large and blur it.

241
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.680
And inside of this mumble jumble, somewhere like BAAMBAAA,

242
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.960
that means pear.

243
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.960
And MUFBA, that means sweet potato.

244
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.020
And all of these letters mean something.

245
00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.530
And if you were just to change one

246
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.263
of these letters like the F to A,

247
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.750
it would sorta somewhere in that pizza,

248
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.820
that the thing changed.

249
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.840
So, when we load it really quickly,

250
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.660
it's actually just scaling it up.

251
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:15.660
And then I've applied a image-rendering pixelated to it,

252
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.113
just to give it a cool little fade in effect.

253
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.240
If you don't like that, you can take it off.

254
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.830
This is the scrollbar styles

255
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.230
to get it to work cross browser.

256
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.080
This is styling of all of my HRs.

257
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.610
And then this just puts a max-width of 100%

258
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.510
on all of my images so they don't overflow.

259
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.260
So, pretty basic styles.

260
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.550
Now, in order to use these global styles,

261
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.230
we stick them in a variable.

262
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.780
And then I exported them from this file.

263
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.690
And then we need to inject them

264
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.100
into our application somewhere.

265
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.030
So, at a high level, I'm gonna inject it into our layout.

266
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.520
And I'm just gonna go in here and write my global styles.

267
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.210
And then I'm gonna use my handy-dandy import trick

268
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.790
to import GlobalStyles from the actual relative path

269
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.950
where it lives.

270
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.890
Now, if we go to our application, we should be able

271
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.000
to see that it's starting to look a little bit different.

272
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.270
Good, so you see the background

273
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:23.070
of my body tag now has that cool pattern on it.

274
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.780
And if we make this a little bit bigger

275
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.500
and get into inspecting our, where is it?

276
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.973
It's on the HTML.

277
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.920
You'll see that the background image is not equal

278
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.270
to this is the background image

279
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:45.260
with the cheese and everything, it's not equal to bg.svg.

280
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.450
It's equal to bg-386111, whatever.

281
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:53.060
And that's because Gatsby took that SVG,

282
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.590
put it through its compressor or anything else

283
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.070
that it needs to do and puts a unique identifier on it.

284
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:00.470
And what's cool about that is that

285
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.580
if you ever change your BG, Gatsby will know,

286
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.680
and it'll put a different random identifier on it.

287
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.790
And then you never have the issue where you have

288
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.850
to tell people to do a hard refresh,

289
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.920
because it's literally a different file name

290
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.440
and it won't be cashed in there.

291
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.070
So, which is pretty nifty.

292
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.950
So that's it for global styles.

293
00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.900
If you ever have something you want globally,

294
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.990
you just pop it in this file.

295
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.130
Next, I'm gonna do a little bit more global styles,

296
00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.153
but I have my own file that's just related to topography.
