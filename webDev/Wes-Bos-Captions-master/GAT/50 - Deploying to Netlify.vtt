00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:04.543
<v Narrator>All right, probably the like</v>

2
00:00:04.543 --> 00:00:08.700
the most popular way to host a Gatsby website,

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.440
even though literally you can deploy it anywhere,

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.273
is Netlify

5
00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:14.070
because Netlify will of course take care

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.570
of making your website fast to load

7
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.160
and to host it and all that stuff.

8
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.200
But they also do the whole build thing for you.

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.440
And it can be triggered either when something,

10
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.560
some data in sanity changes,

11
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.290
or it can be triggered when like your Git repo changes,

12
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.140
which is pretty cool.

13
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.680
So go to netlify.com and create an account.

14
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.010
And then what we'll do is when you have your dashboard,

15
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.030
you click on a new site from Git

16
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.840
and you connect it to whatever your Git provider is.

17
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.560
So mine is going to be Github.

18
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.440
And now what I need to actually do

19
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.850
is to put my website on Github.

20
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.640
So you might already have yours on a Github repo

21
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.330
and it doesn't matter, the folder structure,

22
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.163
anything like that.

23
00:00:54.163 --> 00:00:56.740
Mine is not currently on Github,

24
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.590
so I'm going to go ahead and do that.

25
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.680
You can either put just the Gatsby's folder on Git

26
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.200
or, and this is probably more likely,

27
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.420
is you want to put both the sanity backend

28
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.520
and the Gatsby frontend in one Git repo.

29
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.150
Well, I shouldn't say more likely

30
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.180
because there's lots of different use cases

31
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.480
if you want to have a backend and a frontend,

32
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.970
but because

33
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.180
I have put both of them into the starter files

34
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.013
in the same repo,

35
00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:25.320
I'm going to put them both into one repo on

36
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.653
my Git.

37
00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:30.084
So the way that you do is you git init

38
00:01:30.084 --> 00:01:32.730
and that's going to create a new Git repo.

39
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.470
We'll make sure that we have a git ignore.

40
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.590
So I'm gonna open this up in my VS code,

41
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.090
and I'm gonna create a new file called .gitignore.

42
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.850
And I'm just going to take the contents

43
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.240
of the current starter file.

44
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.400
So github.com/wesbos/master-gatsby

45
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.670
and take a look at the git ignore here

46
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.173
and edit it.

47
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.150
Copy everything, put it in there.

48
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.150
This is just a general generic git ignore file

49
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.600
that will cover most of your bases.

50
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.210
So we've got that there.

51
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.440
Then what we want to do is to say, git status,

52
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.390
take a look at everything we've got.

53
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.963
We'll git add everything.

54
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.650
So git add everything.

55
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.090
Oh, no, git add -a

56
00:02:23.753 --> 00:02:25.102
and git commit

57
00:02:25.102 --> 00:02:26.190
<v ->m</v>

58
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.640
or -m.

59
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.483
We'll say everything.

60
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.290
Okay, good.

61
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.200
Then we have to hook it up to an actual Github repo.

62
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.663
So go to github.com.

63
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.423
Gotta create a new repo.

64
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.693
We'll call it Slick's Slices.

65
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.440
And you obviously call it your own thing.

66
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.220
Wes Bos

67
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.373
Slick's slices example.

68
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.190
You can make it public or private.

69
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.113
Go ahead and create the repo.

70
00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:05.780
Then I'm going to, I already did all the init, add, commit,

71
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.500
and then I'm going to add the origin.

72
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.250
And then I'm going to push

73
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.287
up to Github.

74
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.080
While that's uploading, I'll go back to my Netlify here.

75
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.307
And when you connect it to Github,

76
00:03:19.307 --> 00:03:20.900
you can either allow it to have access

77
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.580
to all of your repos, or you can do it

78
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.910
one by one.

79
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.770
In our case, I'm not going to give

80
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.780
a random company, or they're not a random company,

81
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.700
I certainly trust them,

82
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.560
but I'm not going to give some company access to everything,

83
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.040
every single line of code that I've written,

84
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.710
no matter how much trust I have in them.

85
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.540
So we go to this one right here

86
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.250
and you want to click on your actual username,

87
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.140
gonna go ahead and log in.

88
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.740
And then here we go, select a repository.

89
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.830
So these are all different websites that I've used

90
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.960
on for Gatsby.

91
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.570
And I gotta add a new one.

92
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.530
So we'll call it Slick's Slices.

93
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.570
There we go, add it, save it, good.

94
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.343
And then it should be available, here we go.

95
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.150
And the branch to deploy is going to be master.

96
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.200
The build command

97
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.740
is npm run build,

98
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.660
and then the publish directory is

99
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.913
going to be, I believe, gatsby/public.

100
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.183
And then we also need some advanced settings.

101
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.110
Doesn't look like you can do that just yet.

102
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.963
So we'll go ahead and deploy that.

103
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.200
Now this is not gonna work just yet.

104
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.520
And the reason behind that is because

105
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.000
it's going to look in here for your Gatsby website.

106
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.210
So we need to tell it that our Gatsby website

107
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.010
lives inside of the Gatsby directory.

108
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.690
So it doesn't look

109
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.870
like we could do that when we set it up.

110
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.770
But now let's go back to site settings

111
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.310
and there should be a setting around here somewhere.

112
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.180
I believe it's under build and deploy.

113
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.013
Here we go.

114
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.083
Edit settings,

115
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.080
repository base directory.

116
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.350
Okay, the directory to change before we start the build.

117
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.543
This is where we'll look for package json

118
00:05:23.543 --> 00:05:25.500
and the NRC et cetera, et cetera.

119
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.200
So it's Gatsby, good.

120
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.460
And then the publish directory is

121
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.123
public.

122
00:05:34.756 --> 00:05:37.330
And I believe that's what we want,

123
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.150
so let's go ahead and save it.

124
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.550
We'll go back to our overview

125
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.260
and we can go ahead and trigger a new deploy.

126
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.820
So production deploys, trigger deploy.

127
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.750
If you're ever having troubles with your deploy,

128
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.270
always choose the clear cache and deploy site.

129
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.540
And that, the deploy site will just reuse

130
00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.240
any like cached images and things like that that we want.

131
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.190
So let's just clear cache in this case.

132
00:06:02.546 --> 00:06:03.900
And you can sort of watch what's happening.

133
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.620
So it's kind of cool because it's doing what we did here

134
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.050
when we ran npm run build,

135
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.940
but it's doing it on Netlify's servers.

136
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.190
And you can see that it's

137
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.360
installing Node, npm installing all of our dependencies.

138
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.650
One thing I think we'll probably run into

139
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.600
is the fact that our ENV file did not make it.

140
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.180
And that's good because you should never have

141
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.340
your secrets, which is .env, show up publicly

142
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.880
on GitHub or even private, if it's a private repo.

143
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.770
You don't necessarily want your passwords

144
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.770
and everything like that.

145
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.130
So what we'll have to do

146
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.940
while we wait for this to build the first time,

147
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.880
is to go back

148
00:06:47.482 --> 00:06:49.893
to our settings,

149
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.180
deploy settings here

150
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.363
and it's somewhere in here,

151
00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.553
environment,

152
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.740
environmental variables.

153
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.470
So we'll go ahead and edit these.

154
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.100
And you can say,

155
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.500
let's just go ahead and start pasting them over.

156
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.910
Gatsby page size.

157
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.743
Whoops.

158
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.393
Two.

159
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.570
Gatsby hot loader,

160
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.730
actually, that one doesn't matter

161
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.530
because that's only for development.

162
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.890
We don't need that one.

163
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.130
The mail host, so I'm going to leave this

164
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.730
as the ethereal email,

165
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.750
but you would likely go to something like Postmark

166
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.420
and sign up for a Postmark account

167
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.290
and use this in production

168
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.440
and then paste in your actual credentials

169
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.710
that Postmark gives you

170
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.110
or any transactional email service.

171
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.620
It doesn't really matter,

172
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.103
I'm just a fan of Postmark myself.

173
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.300
Gatsby serverless base.

174
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.190
So this is kind of important.

175
00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.073
This is no longer going to be localhost:8888.

176
00:08:00.775 --> 00:08:03.170
It is now going to just be

177
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.703
in our case, you can just use a relative path like that.

178
00:08:10.014 --> 00:08:12.200
And then finally Gatsby GraphQL endpoint,

179
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.500
that will stay the same as well

180
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.490
because that's pointing directly to our sanity server.

181
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.563
Give that a save.

182
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.640
Then we'll go back to our deploys

183
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.520
and see how that one is doing.

184
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.163
It's still building, but I don't believe,

185
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.720
I don't know, it seems to be,

186
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.650
it seems to be running.

187
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.000
Maybe just because we put those,

188
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.220
put that data in before it needed it.

189
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.610
So maybe we did make it in time.

190
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.510
If it didn't, if it ends up not running,

191
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.990
you can go ahead and just cancel the deploy and rerun it.

192
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.530
But I'm going to see if this will run myself.

193
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.180
I should probably take the console log out (laughs)

194
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.320
for Gatsby website.

195
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.403
Let me do that while we wait.

196
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.713
Console.log.

197
00:08:58.418 --> 00:08:59.251
That,

198
00:09:00.314 --> 00:09:01.147
that.

199
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.883
Gatsby config.

200
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.053
All right, that looks like we got everything out.

201
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.800
I believe if you have console logs

202
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.233
in your other ones as well,

203
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.750
yeah if you've got console logs in any of your

204
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.220
files like this, this slice masters

205
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.770
and

206
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.280
pizza, all of that data.

207
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.840
If you've got any of the console logs

208
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.480
in your actual React files

209
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.940
that will show up in your terminal

210
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.083
because it is literally running the React file for you.

211
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.133
There we go, looks like the Netlify build is complete.

212
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.700
It worked.

213
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.770
Then it'll give you this hilarious URL,

214
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.440
which you can go and visit your website

215
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.750
and boom, looks like it is working.

216
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.450
The only thing that won't work is these ones.

217
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.550
And tell me why,

218
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.600
the reason is because we probably have a cores issue,

219
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.950
there we go.

220
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.640
We've got a cores issue when fetching data

221
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.160
from our sanity,

222
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.640
because sanity is now saying no, no, no, no, no.

223
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.100
I've never heard of this domain name.

224
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.440
I'm not gonna allow that.

225
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.890
So we can go ahead and fix that.

226
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.603
Going going sanity.io.

227
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.230
Log in.

228
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.290
Go to our Slick's Slices,

229
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.453
settings, API.

230
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.080
And you can add the API origins here

231
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.640
and we will

232
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.160
take that domain name.

233
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.800
So in our case, you can either just put

234
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.880
the whole domain name

235
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.510
or you could do *.netlify.app

236
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.850
Or if you choose to use a custom domain with Netlify,

237
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:47.820
you can do that as well.

238
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.610
So in our case, I'll just put that.

239
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.080
I don't think we actually need

240
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.790
allow credentials to be turned on

241
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.820
because we're not doing any authentication,

242
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.670
we're just pulling data

243
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.603
at the origin.

244
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.910
Now, when I refresh this page, that data should show up.

245
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.170
Looks like we've got one more issue where it's

246
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:14.890
going to /undefined for that data.

247
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.580
I believe that is probably because

248
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:24.660
that is trying to grab the Gatsby GraphQL endpoint.

249
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.410
Maybe that didn't work initially.

250
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.053
So we'll just go ahead and rebuild it one more time.

251
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.920
I could edit this out and make it look perfect,

252
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.060
but this is honestly my experience in deploying a website

253
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.130
is, oh, I forgot to add that origin.

254
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.540
Oh, let me, let me rebuild it again, one more time.

255
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.080
And after two or three times,

256
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.340
you got all the bugs ironed out.

257
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.460
So I'm gonna just take you along the ride for me,

258
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.293
trying to figure it out.

259
00:11:47.293 --> 00:11:48.750
So go to deploys,

260
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.423
go ahead and rerun it.

261
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.640
And then go grab a coffee

262
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.743
and we'll come back when this sucker is fully deployed.

263
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.270
All right after a couple of minutes, it deployed again.

264
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.730
So I'm going to go back to,

265
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.330
it's the same URL every single time.

266
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.590
So you don't have to worry about

267
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:07.680
going to the URL again,

268
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.360
just refresh the one if you've got it open.

269
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.200
And they're fetching data, and there we go.

270
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.220
Now that, that data.

271
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.510
So again, the reason why that wasn't pulling initially

272
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.500
is because the environmental variables,

273
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.980
the GraphQL endpoint, I put that in too late.

274
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.440
And by the time it had built, this was undefined.

275
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.880
So it was trying to hit undefined for URL.

276
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.240
And then if you rerun the build

277
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.260
once those environmental variables have been inputted

278
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.840
into your Netlify, then everything is looking peachy.

279
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.060
So here's our website.

280
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.100
It looks like things are working.

281
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.900
Let's just try click around to it.

282
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.530
There's our different pizzas.

283
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.930
Look around at one of the pizzas.

284
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.600
Go to our slice masters, there they are.

285
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.890
All of our pagination works just good.

286
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.670
And our order form

287
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.750
looks like it is working as well.

288
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.020
So that is how you deploy that thing to Netlify.

289
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.810
Other things that Netlify has

290
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.840
is analytics is only on the paid.

291
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.870
I have a paid account.

292
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.970
So if you want analytics, they will show up.

293
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:07.803
But it's kind of cool

294
00:13:07.803 --> 00:13:10.540
because you don't have to put Google Analytics

295
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.230
into your website

296
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.290
and it will still pull analytics from the server side.

297
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.330
What other things,

298
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.840
all of our functions are automatically deployed.

299
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.900
See, look.

300
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.100
There's our place order.

301
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.880
You can also see any console logs from your thing.

302
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.700
So if you're having any errors and what not,

303
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.270
that will sort of log itself in there.

304
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.471
And then of course you can put your own custom domain name

305
00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:36.070
on your site by going to site settings,

306
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.720
domain management.

307
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.940
And then here you can option, you can change the name of it.

308
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.170
So it's not this really long URL.

309
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.050
You could just say slicksslices.netlify.app.

310
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.340
And you can also add a custom domain name

311
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:53.340
if you've got a .com or .org or you name it.

312
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.570
Last thing we need to do

313
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.830
is obviously if we make a change to one of our websites,

314
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.600
so if I go to my index.js

315
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.000
and I say hot slices and add an exclamation mark

316
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.240
and I were to push that.

317
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.360
So now there's a change, git status,

318
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.320
we see there's a change to our index.js.

319
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.110
I'll git add all,

320
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:17.330
git commit, change.

321
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.313
Oh, and git push.

322
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.653
And if we go over to our deploys here,

323
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.090
it should then trigger a change in our Netlify.

324
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.950
And it'll rebuild and redeploy the entire website for us.

325
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.750
See look at that, there's a change.

326
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.780
It's going to build.

327
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.020
After a couple of minutes, it will actually be deployed.

328
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.960
The other thing we need to know is if we go

329
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.630
to our sanity dashboard,

330
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.100
click right here,

331
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.420
and we make a change to one of the pizzas.

332
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.693
So let's, let's find one of our pizzas.

333
00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.520
Here comes truffle, let's edit that pizza.

334
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.420
I'll add an exclamation mark to the end

335
00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.820
and go ahead and publish it.

336
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.563
And we go to that pizza.

337
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.693
Pizzas,

338
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.963
here comes truffle.

339
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.570
It's not updated.

340
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.910
Well, like how do you get that?

341
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.840
Do you have to like edit a file and redeploy it?

342
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.063
Well, no, you can set up a web hook in sanity

343
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.610
so that sanity will push

344
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:22.990
every single time that you have it.

345
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.420
So I've got just the docs on how to do that right here.

346
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.240
So it looks like what we need to do

347
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.360
is to go to settings, build and deploy.

348
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.773
So settings,

349
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.053
build and deploy.

350
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.103
Go to continuous deployment,

351
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.760
go down to build hooks.

352
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.433
And we'll click add a build hook.

353
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.280
I'll call that

354
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.230
rebuild

355
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.850
from

356
00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:58.733
sanity.

357
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:01.913
Go ahead and save it.

358
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.993
It's gonna give us this URL here.

359
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.230
And every single time you hit this URL with a post request,

360
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.040
it's gonna rebuild your website.

361
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.070
So we can actually set that up in sanity

362
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.860
to do it for us.

363
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.060
So we'll go back to our terminal here,

364
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.853
go to our sanity tab and say, sanity hook create.

365
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.930
We'll call it a Netlify deploy

366
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.280
and its production.

367
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.383
The hook URL is what we just copied there.

368
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:40.950
And we're up and running.

369
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.010
So now I believe

370
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.170
we should be able to go and edit one of our pizzas.

371
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.943
Let's do two exclamation marks on here comes truffle.

372
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.113
Go back to our deploys of Netlify.

373
00:16:56.174 --> 00:16:58.937
There we go, deploy triggered, rebuilding from sanity.

374
00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:00.630
That's because we changed our data.

375
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.180
Once it's done,

376
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.810
that will be redeployed to our actual website.

377
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.660
So that's pretty easy, pretty slick

378
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.680
once you get it up and running,

379
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.660
especially once you've done six or seven of these websites.

380
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.120
It's a pretty neat way

381
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.120
to go ahead and deploy your application.
