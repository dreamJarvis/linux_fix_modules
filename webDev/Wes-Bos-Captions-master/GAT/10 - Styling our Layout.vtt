1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.793
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.293
<v Instructor>All right, in this video</v>

3
00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:08.900
we're going to work on the sort of outline of the website.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.430
We get these sort of slash dashes here

5
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.810
and as well as sort of confining it

6
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.620
so that it doesn't cause us this horizontal scroll.

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.940
So I'll open up layout.js,

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.940
and we are going to make a content style.

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.940
So I'll say const content styles equals style.div.

10
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.800
You notice how I'm not putting this

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.720
in its own file.

12
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.730
This is generally how I approach my CSSs,

13
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.670
I'll just put it above the component that I'm styling.

14
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.070
And then as this file starts to get too big,

15
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.120
or as I need to reuse this style in many components,

16
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.030
then I'll put it into its own file.

17
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.030
And that keeps me from unnecessarily creating files,

18
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.970
just for the heck of it.

19
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.280
Some people much prefer

20
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.260
to always create their own file for each thing,

21
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.680
and I find that a bit harder to jump around.

22
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.040
So that's just personal preference,

23
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.410
there's no right or wrong way to go about that.

24
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.960
So I'm going to import that styled.

25
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.960
Boom, and then you see it's underlined here

26
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.860
and it says that's because I have relative imports here

27
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.860
and then I have like an MPM modules or node modules.

28
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.870
Usually when you save it, it's supposed to move it up,

29
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.740
but I'm gonna go ahead and move it up myself

30
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.630
and, oh I gotta move it all the way to the top there.

31
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.500
Same with normalize CSS, there we go.

32
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.650
Okay, cool.

33
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.440
Then we will say,

34
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.430
background is equal to white and padding is two rem.

35
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.600
And we'll go down here, and we don't need this link.

36
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.340
And we'll take our content styles

37
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.430
and put our nav children and footer inside of it.

38
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.840
And then this div here,

39
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.170
this is an unnecessary div,

40
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.420
the only reason I have this div here

41
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.240
is because I wanna return multiple things.

42
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.423
So if we've removed it,

43
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.780
you'll see we we get an error,

44
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.400
cannot return adjacent JSX elements.

45
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.150
So you need to wrap them in some sort of tag,

46
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.880
in our case there's a div,

47
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.830
but you can wrap it in a react fragment,

48
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.460
and the way that you can do react fragments in JSX.

49
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.640
Normally it's like that's react. what is it, .frag?

50
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.560
There we go, fragment, but you can just use open.

51
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.020
I call them ghost tags,

52
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.070
open and closing tags that have nothing inside of it.

53
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.640
And you'll see that the reason why I do that

54
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.040
is because these things are not actually rendering out

55
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.040
any dom, they're simply just sticking CSS into the page.

56
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.008
All right, so we've got our white on there

57
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:54.280
and then I also have this, look at the answer here.

58
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.810
You'll see we've got this like little cool little border.

59
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.720
So we're going to do that now as well.

60
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.090
So we'll make that called site border style.

61
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.393
So const site border styles equals to style.div,

62
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.883
and we'll put a max width of 1,000 px on it.

63
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.120
Margin is going to,

64
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.950
now, these margins are gonna seem a little funny,

65
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.950
12 rem at the top auto, four rem at the bottom

66
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.410
and auto on the left and right.

67
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.760
And you'll see what that does is nothing

68
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.710
'cause I didn't use it.

69
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.710
Okay, so we will wrap the content styles in that.

70
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.290
So we've got our site border styles,

71
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.713
then our content styles.

72
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.430
There we go, and you see by bumping it down a little bit,

73
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.680
that allows the nav to show to us.

74
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.680
But next up, we are going to override the margin top again,

75
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.410
and we're going to use CSS clamp or at a minimum

76
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.100
it needs to be two rem,

77
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.890
at a maximum it's going to be 12 rem.

78
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.020
And then in between those two values,

79
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.773
we're gonna say 10 vw.

80
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.050
And what that does is it scales the margin top value

81
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.250
up and down with a min and max value,

82
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.700
along with the actual size of the logo.

83
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.700
If you remember the size of the logo, we set the font size,

84
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.700
add to a clamp value

85
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.610
and that scales with the width of the browser,

86
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.310
so does the margin top value.

87
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.700
And the reason why I didn't put that right here

88
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.110
is because some browsers don't support this clamp just yet.

89
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.440
So if they don't support it,

90
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.260
they'll just ignore this line entirely,

91
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.340
and then just pick up the 12 rem which looks okay.

92
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.673
And then we say,

93
00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:50.673
background is white and we are going to,

94
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.770
let me actually show you how it's gonna work.

95
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.320
So we'll say put a background red on there,

96
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.220
a real quick second,

97
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.280
and then we'll give ourselves a padding of

98
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.683
let's just say five px.

99
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.110
So you see that red border,

100
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.110
that's what's peaking out behind these content styles

101
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.600
and then the white background is hiding it.

102
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.210
So the padding is actually going to be

103
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.480
a clamp value as well.

104
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.783
You'll see, I'm gonna duplicate the padding value here

105
00:05:17.783 --> 00:05:21.533
and we'll say clamp, minimum five px, one vw,

106
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.600
flex value, and then 25 px at a maximum.

107
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.760
And watch now, see the size of the, it grows.

108
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.670
And you see at a certain point,

109
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.090
it doesn't get any smaller because I have that clamp value

110
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.090
of minimum five, maximum 25 in between one vw,

111
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.953
which is viewport width.

112
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.310
And again, the reason we duplicated it

113
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.620
is because if the browser does not support clamp,

114
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.620
then we'll just fall back to this value here.

115
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.670
I will put a box shadow on it,

116
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.940
zero, zero, five px and three px.

117
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.400
And then the value will be RGBA zero, zero, zero.

118
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.980
So it's a black, and then I like to use 0.44.

119
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.050
I don't like to use that,

120
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.000
that's why I figured out it looks best.

121
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.242
And you'll see that it has

122
00:06:18.242 --> 00:06:22.600
a bit of a box shadow surrounding it.

123
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.277
Okay, so now let's go back to this background here.

124
00:06:24.277 --> 00:06:27.210
And we actually want it to use those stripes

125
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.530
that we used in the logo.

126
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.370
So if you take a look at the logo,

127
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.930
you see, I imported the SVG file.

128
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.440
And again, this is not normally

129
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.120
something you can do in JavaScript,

130
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.440
but by importing it into your JavaScript,

131
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.950
then Gatsby will then turn it into.

132
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.293
Let me see if I can show you the CSS here.

133
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.450
Oh, there we go.

134
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.130
Gatsby will then, oh, it looks like.

135
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.380
Oh, it's so small, I didn't even realize this.

136
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.760
Normally what would happen is,

137
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.160
this background image of our logo URL stripes,

138
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.160
it'll say something like assets/images/stripes.SVG,

139
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.850
but Gatsby was so smart it said,

140
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.940
hey, this thing is pretty tiny.

141
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.270
These little red stripes that you're using,

142
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.710
they're not all that big.

143
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.030
So Gatsby was smart enough to turn it into this,

144
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.460
which is a base 64 representation of the stripes.

145
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.380
And if that's the case,

146
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.100
it doesn't need to make another request.

147
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.050
It doesn't need to download another file,

148
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.670
it just knows that this is the stripes,

149
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.250
which is pretty pretty nifty if you ask me,

150
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.830
and that's just the perfect example of Gatsby

151
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.650
doing the heavy lifting for you.

152
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.420
So we're gonna do that again.

153
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.250
We're gonna import, oh, we're in the wrong file here.

154
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.483
I'll go back into our layout import stripes from.

155
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.620
Where are we here?

156
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.620
So we're in our components folder

157
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.690
and we need to go up a level into assets, images, stripes.

158
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.230
Okay.

159
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:05.230
So we'll go up a level into assets, images, stripes.SVG.

160
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.510
And then we'll just take that URL and say,

161
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.720
background is white,

162
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.080
not red, red was just to show us URL

163
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.452
and then we need to interpolate the stripes variable there.

164
00:08:22.452 --> 00:08:24.351
There we go.

165
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:25.184
Woo.

166
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.743
Looking pretty good.

167
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.680
Next thing I wanna do just in anticipation of media queries,

168
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.410
we'll say at media, whoa, moz user disabled.

169
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:40.893
Max with 1,000 px.

170
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.150
Oh no, 1100 px.

171
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.970
So when we hit the max with the 1100 px,

172
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.970
we'll say margin left is 1.5 rem and margin right.

173
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.790
Do see what I was doing, is a mr-1.5r,

174
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.420
and then I hit my Emmett abbreviation.

175
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.470
Oh, it's even suggesting it for me there.

176
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.570
That's not what I want.

177
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.990
The m is not perfect.

178
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.410
It thinks that's a tag with a class.

179
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.280
So that's the reason why I don't use TAB and Enter,

180
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.800
so I'm just gonna hit my Control + E expansion

181
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.020
and not negative, sorry, just 1.5 rem.

182
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:26.020
And that way, once I hit that 1100 px,

183
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.020
it will pop a little bit of margin

184
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.810
to the left and to the right of our layout here.

185
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.550
Couple more little finessy things,

186
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.650
I would say this is overlapping on top of it.

187
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:40.620
And if I go to gatsby.pizza to look at the final version,

188
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.453
there's a couple little things.

189
00:09:41.453 --> 00:09:44.180
So let's get that little white border going.

190
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.690
So we'll go here.

191
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.523
Say border five px, solid white.

192
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.570
Looking good.

193
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.290
The background is larger on the final version.

194
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.750
So I believe we can go here and just say background size

195
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.700
is 80m, let's see how that looks good.

196
00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:13.870
You can kinda sort of fiddle with this like 500 px.

197
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.870
See that's really small, 1500 px, that would work.

198
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.350
Maybe leave it at 1500 px,

199
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.853
that'll give you a better look as to how it looks.

200
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.400
Now we need to work on our logo here.

201
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.100
We've got all this extra space here

202
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.350
and we've obviously bumped the logo.

203
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.790
We've bumped everything down

204
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.510
and anchored it from the bottom.

205
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.800
But now we need to account for this extra padding here.

206
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.580
And I believe we go to our nav,

207
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.210
go to the unordered list

208
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.890
and we'll say margin top negative six rem,

209
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.410
and that should bump it up enough.

210
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.380
There we go, that's looking pretty good.

211
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.510
One more thing I should say about the nav is that

212
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.700
if you wanna style the links,

213
00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.990
like if we go to the pizza menu,

214
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.410
you'll see that the links have an aria current of page

215
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.870
when you are on that page.

216
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.290
And if you ever wanted to style the current page,

217
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.550
we could go to our nav.

218
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.120
Let's find our link, here we go.

219
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.010
And we could say, and aria-current equals page.

220
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.220
And what that will do is it'll say

221
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.900
if the anchor link has an attribute

222
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.240
of aria current page on it,

223
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.290
then we could say color is equal to var--red.

224
00:11:31.263 --> 00:11:33.620
And then you see now the current page in Gatsby.

225
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.460
So Gatsby will do that for you,

226
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.180
it will figure out what the current pages.

227
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:42.180
You see even the logo is turning red when we're on it,

228
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:47.350
because that is also the current page as well.

229
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.500
So I don't have that as part of my design,

230
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.080
we will use that one to get the pagination.

231
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.250
So I'll just comment that out

232
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.640
just in case you want that

233
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.970
'cause that's a pretty common thing

234
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.970
that you'll wanna do in your website.

235
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.300
All right, that's it for the layout so far,

236
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.353
let's move into generating some data.
