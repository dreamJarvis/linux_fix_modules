00:00:00.673 --> 00:00:03.423
(cheerful music)

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.320
<v Lecturer>All right, let's talk about the sanity backend</v>

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.560
that we're gonna be building.

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.300
So this is the CMS that we're gonna be building.

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.510
It's called Sanity.

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.600
It's a headless CMS,

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.110
which means that, the whole headless term

8
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.060
means that there's no front end, there's no theme,

9
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.190
or there's no way to actually view the data in your website

10
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.610
with Sanity, because it's just the backend,

11
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.340
meaning that we log in,

12
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.877
we're gonna be able to create our content types

13
00:00:30.877 --> 00:00:34.640
and our fields and update data and delete data and all that,

14
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.740
and then the front end is what we're building.

15
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.180
That's Slick's Slices.

16
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.610
And that data is gonna be pulled in via Gatsby,

17
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.180
via a plugin that we use as well as

18
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.080
we're gonna use their graph QL API straight.

19
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.160
So that's what it means as a headless CMS.

20
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.680
And the steps that we take here today will be

21
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.020
almost exactly the same,

22
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.120
regardless of which headless CMS that you take.

23
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.120
You create your data and we're gonna ingest it

24
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.780
into our Gatsby site in a little bit more.

25
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.670
Now, full disclosure, sanity is a sponsor of my podcast,

26
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.450
but they did not pay to be in this tutorial.

27
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.340
I tried out about six or seven of them out there

28
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.960
and I ended up on sanity because I think it's probably

29
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.930
the best balance between up and running quickly

30
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.490
and like done for you.

31
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.070
A lot of it is done for you and you can just use it.

32
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.910
And if you want to customize it,

33
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.130
we're gonna look at how we can do that.

34
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.210
You can customize it, which is kinda cool.

35
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.670
So that's why I'm doing it.

36
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.120
I had a bunch of other companies offer to sponsor

37
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.283
being the CMS in this tutorial, but I thought no.

38
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.060
So let's get rolling.

39
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.530
Sanity.io is the URL that you can have

40
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.950
and we already did this,

41
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.030
but just double check that you have sanity globally

42
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.090
installed on your computer.

43
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.370
You can just type sanity--version

44
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.530
and that will tell you which version you have.

45
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.530
If you get like an error,

46
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.620
like sanity is not a command or something like that,

47
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.030
just go ahead and run this to install globally

48
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.863
on your computer.

49
00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:04.630
Now, normally with a new sanity project,

50
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.050
you type sanity init and what that will do

51
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.120
is it will download all the starter files for you

52
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.170
and it'll give you some base folders

53
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.770
and even it'll give you some examples,

54
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.110
and that's great if you wanna try another project.

55
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.770
However, if we take a look at what I've given you,

56
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.963
it's basically the same output of sanity init.

57
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.430
I didn't do some sneaky coding and give you some of it.

58
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.850
Sometimes people get annoyed when I give them code already,

59
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.050
but this all comes with sanity init.

60
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.060
There's just a couple difference.

61
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.060
I'm using NPM instead of yarn, just to keep it simple.

62
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.130
Yarn has a lot going on right now.

63
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.990
I'm not sure if it will be around for a long time,

64
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.993
so I'm just using that.

65
00:02:48.941 --> 00:02:53.330
And I've got some sample data in here as well as some stuff.

66
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.570
So I basically, and I got VS Code stuff here.

67
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.080
So I basically wanted to give you a folder

68
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.760
with some files in it and sanity init doesn't work

69
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.200
on an empty, that's the only reason

70
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.490
why we're gonna go ahead and do this.

71
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.930
So in order to initialize our app and to log in

72
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.020
and to create a new data set with Sanity,

73
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.020
what you need to do is type sanity init -- reconfigure,

74
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.480
I hit enter.

75
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.150
And what this will do is if you are not already

76
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.360
created an account and signed in with sanity,

77
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.410
it's going to prompt you to create a new account.

78
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.580
If at any time you ever want to re-log in

79
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.550
you just type sanity login,

80
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.030
and that will allow you to go off to the browser, log in

81
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.190
and come back and you will see that you are logged in.

82
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.060
So once you're logged in,

83
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.040
you don't have to create a project or anything like that.

84
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.960
The sanity init is going to do all this for us.

85
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.040
So it has a series of questions for us.

86
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.260
It says, would you like to use an existing project?

87
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.740
You see, I have a couple of existing projects,

88
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.010
or create a new project.

89
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.580
That's what we're gonna do; create a new project.

90
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.240
What do you want to call it?

91
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.940
I'm gonna call it Slicks Slices

92
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.540
and just put your name at the end of there.

93
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.890
That just makes it simple if we're sharing files

94
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.840
or you're trying to get help or something in the chat room,

95
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.320
just put your name on the end.

96
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.303
So you have that.

97
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.000
Then it says your content will be stored

98
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.330
in a dataset that can be public or private.

99
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.070
We'll talk about that in a bit.

100
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.080
By default, it will be called production.

101
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.850
We are gonna go ahead and use production

102
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.520
however you can also have multiple data sets.

103
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.430
So if you wanna do some testing on development

104
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.700
before you move into production,

105
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.230
you're able to do that with sanity.

106
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.330
So I'll just say yes, and it creates a dataset

107
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.770
in the sanity dashboard and we are up and running.

108
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.770
If you take a look here, you might have a yarn.lock file.

109
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.720
Sometimes I see that pop up and not,

110
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.520
you can delete that if you do see it pop up.

111
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.360
The reason why is because we have a similar package

112
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.860
called package lock json,

113
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.580
it's just two different tools

114
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.640
to work with node packages that we have here.

115
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.890
Now, in order to start it, we type npm start.

116
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.150
That is in turn going to run the command sanity start

117
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.500
and that's gonna fire up a little local host server

118
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.580
that will give us something called sanity studio.

119
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.370
So sanity is the API that we interact with

120
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.510
and sanity studio is the actual UI

121
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.430
that would log into and create,

122
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.830
update, read, delete all of our data.

123
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.710
So there we go; local host 3333.

124
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.730
It will pop up here.

125
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.880
It might ask you to log in.

126
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.390
Here we go, it's asking me to log in.

127
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.240
So I'm gonna go ahead and do that.

128
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.660
And I'm logged in.

129
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.700
There's nothing here yet cause we haven't done anything,

130
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.040
but we can go ahead and start making our first schema.

131
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.040
So if we take a look at sanity.json and scroll down here,

132
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.630
you'll see that there are parts, and these are essentially

133
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.900
just pieces of JavaScript file that need to be loaded.

134
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.460
You only ever need to really touch this once when we do

135
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.050
a custom one and you'll see that it goes to the schema.js.

136
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.990
So if we open that up, you'll see here,

137
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.810
we import createSchema,

138
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.610
again, this is all stuff that comes with sanity init.

139
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.600
It's not something you would probably have to remember

140
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.350
or memorize or anything like that.

141
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.050
The important thing is here is that we take

142
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.730
all of our data types and concatenate them into our schema.

143
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.540
So we can go ahead and make our own schema.

144
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.040
Let's start with the pizza schema.

145
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.620
We'll go over to our schema folder, make a new file.

146
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.183
Lowercase P, pizza.js.

147
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.400
And in here, we simply just are going to be exporting

148
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.540
an object that has a bunch of data in it.

149
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.180
So we can just export default, curly brackets,

150
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.680
and we give it a couple of properties.

151
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.620
The name is pizza,

152
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.290
the title is going to be pizzas.

153
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.710
So this is the important thing, the name,

154
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.190
this is the computer name

155
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.250
and this is the visible title

156
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.350
and the type is going to be a document.

157
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.200
You can also create your own fields in here

158
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.880
and we'll be doing that in a future.

159
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.550
Then what we wanna do,

160
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.810
we'll be adding our own fields in just a second,

161
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.100
but what we wanna do is go back

162
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.520
into our schema and import this.

163
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.883
So go down here and say import pizza from pizza.

164
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.440
And then we will pass the reference

165
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.150
to the pizza schema down here.

166
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.600
Then when you save it, it will regen

167
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.230
and reload the sanity Studio here.

168
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.440
It looks like it has to have fields array.

169
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.440
So we'll go here, say fields is going to be an array.

170
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.260
And here's where we define all of the different fields

171
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.460
in an array of objects.

172
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.460
So the first field is going to be our name of the pizza.

173
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.550
So we'll just call it name and the title is going to be,

174
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.010
again, this is the human readable one,

175
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.310
we can call it pizza name.

176
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.380
The type of field is going to be the string.

177
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.190
So if you look at the sanity docs,

178
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.130
they have all kinds of different inputs

179
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.990
and we'll be using a handful of them throughout this course,

180
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.660
as well as creating our own.

181
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.620
And then finally,

182
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.033
the description is going to be the name of the pizza.

183
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:27.570
Now I bet this will give us some data here,

184
00:08:28.183 --> 00:08:30.180
here we go, pizzas,

185
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.880
and it will allow us to create a new pizza

186
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.390
and we should see just the pizza name,

187
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.240
the name of the pizza and the actual field here.

188
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.570
So don't create one just yet,

189
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.280
we gotta do the rest of the fields.

190
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.360
One thing I wanna do is do an icon.

191
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.070
So here you can say icon

192
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.730
and you can give it any react component.

193
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.850
It's actually kinda interesting.

194
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.300
So if you wanted to, you could just return a bunch of X's

195
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.783
and I believe that should, oh, I forgot a comma.

196
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.463
I believe that should render out there.

197
00:09:03.463 --> 00:09:04.296
Here we go.

198
00:09:04.296 --> 00:09:08.200
So you could render out a pizza emoji if you wanted to.

199
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.580
Pizza, here we go.

200
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.230
Oh, it's gotta be in quotes

201
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.530
and you'll see whatever we pass as the icon

202
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.363
will be rendered out.

203
00:09:15.363 --> 00:09:16.610
So it's kinda interesting.

204
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.170
Everything in sanity studio is a react component

205
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.210
so you can pass it a react component if you want.

206
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.910
In our case, I'm going to be using

207
00:09:26.047 --> 00:09:28.410
a library called React Icons

208
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.600
in order to import the icons myself.

209
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.300
So we're going to import.

210
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.023
It's called MD Local Pizza.

211
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.870
And we'll import that from React Icons forward slash MD.

212
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.830
So React Icons is a library that has, I don't know,

213
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.840
15 different icon libraries built into it.

214
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.210
And there's a couple of different libraries.

215
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.633
MD, I believe it stands for mark down.

216
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.320
Is that true?

217
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.640
React icons, let's see.

218
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.540
No, it stands for material design not mark down.

219
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.380
And that's the icon set I'm gonna be using.

220
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.490
And then I also like to import it not as the long name,

221
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.350
but just as icon.

222
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.320
And then what that will allow me to do is just

223
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.300
pass icon as icon, or if I save this,

224
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.070
you'll see that it goes from icon icon just to simply that

225
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.330
and that's just the shorthand of the property

226
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.660
and the variable name being the same thing.

227
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.520
Now I'll go back to my sanity dashboard

228
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.800
and it's not showing up and it's a lower D.

229
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.210
One thing, if you goof these up a lot,

230
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.660
you can use the react icons

231
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.690
and you can just search for pizza.

232
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.090
It'll show you the actual pizza icon

233
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.110
and you can just click it and it will copy

234
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.067
and you paste it in there

235
00:10:44.067 --> 00:10:47.080
and that will avoid any goof ups of typing it.

236
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.200
You can see there's a whole bunch of different pizza icons

237
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.160
in there, or you can use an emoji, whatever you want.

238
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.210
Oh, here we go.

239
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.090
Looking good.
Okay.

240
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.170
So let's keep going with the rest of these fields.

241
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.810
So we also need a slug field.

242
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.470
So what I like to do is take the first field that we have,

243
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.040
including the closing comma and just duplicate it.

244
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.040
And then we'll say the name is slug, title is slug.

245
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.300
The type is a slug and I'll show you

246
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.190
what that is in just a second.

247
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.110
And then there's not a description,

248
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.300
oh, you can add a description,

249
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.630
but in this case we don't need it, self-explanatory,

250
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.467
but we have an options object inside there.

251
00:11:24.467 --> 00:11:27.930
And we say the source of the slug comes from the name field.

252
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.640
So that comes from this, it's gonna be auto-generated.

253
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.270
And then the max length of the slug

254
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.540
will be 100 characters.

255
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.270
We don't want it to be any longer than that.

256
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.710
Now watch what happens.

257
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.983
We can type in a pizza like pepperoni,

258
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.550
and then you can click generate,

259
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.500
and it will automatically generate a slug.

260
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.960
So, I love to eat pizza and generate,

261
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.920
and you see it will slug-ify

262
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.040
whatever field that we linked it to right there.

263
00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.053
Let's copy that first one again and keep going.

264
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.683
We want an image of the pizza, so image.

265
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:10.570
The title will be photo of,

266
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.580
we'll just call image,

267
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.230
type, it's going to be an image

268
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:20.070
and options is hotspot is true.

269
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.650
Let me show you what this hotspot thing is.

270
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.573
It's pretty nifty.

271
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.500
So when you go and upload a file in sanity studio.

272
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.610
So I have supplied you with a bunch of images

273
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.240
in the sample data folder of the sanity folder

274
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.600
so you can grab those there if you want them.

275
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.973
So upload this one.

276
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.620
And when you edit that image,

277
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.080
you'll see that it gives you this, oh, that's funny.

278
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.860
It like perfectly circled the pizza.

279
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.910
That's just cause it's an oval.

280
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.870
It's not some sort of pizza detection thing,

281
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.780
but what you can do is you can hotspot

282
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.530
the important information like somebody's face or a device

283
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.580
and then when we have different sizes for mobile, landscape,

284
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.410
pano, square, it will make sure that that important hotspot

285
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.340
is always in the center of the photo

286
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.520
and then the rest of it won't be cropped off.

287
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.910
So that's a really cool feature that sanity has built in.

288
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.820
We also need two more things.

289
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.310
We need toppings and a price.

290
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.090
Right now we don't have the toppings data typed

291
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.730
so we're gonna leave that off until we create it

292
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.140
and then we're gonna create a relationship

293
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.070
between toppings and pizzas.

294
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.580
So we'll go with the last one.

295
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.700
Just paste that first one in again,

296
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.603
and we'll name it the price,

297
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.403
type of a number, and the description,

298
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.203
price of the pizza in cents.

299
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.410
Now, there is a couple more options that you can have

300
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.660
for this one and in our case,

301
00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.870
I want it to be a minimum $10 pizza.

302
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.130
You don't want anyone accidentally putting like a $4 pizza

303
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.700
and us going out of business.

304
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:12.700
So we'll say validation, property, and we get a rule prop.

305
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.533
And from that, you can say rule.min, 1000.

306
00:14:18.403 --> 00:14:23.310
So that's $10 and you can also chain, you could say max,

307
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.320
you only want a maximum of $50 pizza

308
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.160
and there's a whole different set of rules.

309
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.660
So that's how you do data validation inside of sanity.

310
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.040
It's pretty cool because this is just a function

311
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.970
so you could add any logic that you want in there.

312
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.670
And they specifically give you this rule object

313
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.680
that has a number of helper methods for common things,

314
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.200
minimum, maximum, includes, things like that.

315
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.380
And then we will also,

316
00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.140
let's add a to do, add custom component

317
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.520
because I wanna show you how to do custom input components

318
00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.480
in sanity because, like price is a number,

319
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.370
we want a little bit more control over how it looks.

320
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.830
And I'm gonna show you how to do that in a coming video.

321
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.240
So give that a save

322
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.910
and now you'll see that we've got all of our,

323
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.860
that's actually cool, it just hot reloads it

324
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.220
and keeps the data that I have

325
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.610
even though this is not a saved value just yet.

326
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:23.610
So we could say the price of the pizza is $10 and 34 cents

327
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.913
and go ahead and hit publish on that.

328
00:15:26.894 --> 00:15:27.860
You see that now we have pizza.

329
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.210
You can make a few more but hold off on that

330
00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.620
just until we create the other data types

331
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.827
in the coming videos.
