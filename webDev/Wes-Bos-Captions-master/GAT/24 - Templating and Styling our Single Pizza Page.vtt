00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:02.789
(cheerful music)

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.830
<v ->Alright, let's get working on rendering out</v>

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.340
the single pizza page.

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.819
So we will go into single pizza page right here,

5
00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:15.350
and, we need to destructure,

6
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.040
the data that comes in,

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.010
and I believe it's like this.

8
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.463
And we should be able to console.log the data.

9
00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:27.570
There we go,

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.570
they got our pizza.

11
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.160
Okay, so, and then we can just say const pizza,

12
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.340
or maybe destructure that further,

13
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.032
pizza is equal to data.

14
00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:39.600
You can also destructure this a little bit deeper.

15
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.630
Maybe we'll do that here,

16
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.340
I know I said I don't like doing that,

17
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.530
but I'd like to leave you with an example

18
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.233
of destructuring it even further.

19
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.343
Then we should be able to console log pizza.

20
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.523
Here we go.

21
00:00:55.523 --> 00:00:57.480
So, the downside to that is now that

22
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.148
if I wanna console log pizza or data,

23
00:00:59.148 --> 00:01:02.070
sorry, like if we had another query here,

24
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.290
it doesn't exist.

25
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.840
You'd have to destructure whatever

26
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.000
it is that you want from that,

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.503
but whatever.

28
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.260
I'll leave you with that example there.

29
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.090
That's, destructuring a property,

30
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.400
two levels deep.

31
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.400
Now, we'll go into here and we'll return a div,

32
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.010
and we will render out the image.

33
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.290
So we'll give ourselves an image and we have

34
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.840
to import IMG from Gatsby image

35
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.180
just because it's,

36
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.842
I don't think it's called gats IMG in the package

37
00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:37.193
and that's why the auto import doesn't work.

38
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.210
Then, we can say fluid

39
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.293
is equal to pizza.image.asset.fluid.

40
00:01:47.926 --> 00:01:48.759
There we go.

41
00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:49.910
That was our nice pizza showing up.

42
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.710
and then, we'll give ourselves another div here

43
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.543
and that's because we're gonna

44
00:01:55.543 --> 00:01:57.950
use some CSS grid in just a second

45
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.466
H2 is the class of Mark,

46
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:01.690
we'll give the pizza name

47
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.230
and then we need to loop over all

48
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.160
of the toppings that are on there.

49
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.390
So, give ourselves an unordered list,

50
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.660
curly brackets, pizza.toppings.map

51
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.810
topping, for each topping, or turn-a-list item,

52
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.470
we'll go ahead and put the key of the topping.id right away,

53
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.603
And then we'll put the topping.name

54
00:02:28.603 --> 00:02:30.700
in that list item.

55
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.303
Let's see what we got here.

56
00:02:32.303 --> 00:02:33.136
Here we go.

57
00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:34.560
Cook Norris chicken, onion peppers.

58
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.720
Cool.

59
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.340
Now let's whip up a quick little grid,

60
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.710
so that these things will go side by side.

61
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.053
So const pizza grid is equal to style.div.

62
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.373
We need the auto import styled,

63
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.030
see that, it popped in right there.

64
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.060
It will display

65
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.630
grid, grid gap to rem grid template columns.

66
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.980
That's gonna be repeat auto fill

67
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.830
min max 200px.

68
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.790
Ooh, 200px not 2000.

69
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.263
Don't go crazy on this,

70
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.933
and I believe grid.

71
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.260
We gotta actually use the grid.

72
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.620
I'm like, it's not showing up.

73
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.453
That's cause,

74
00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:28.770
that's why I like this little yellow underline,

75
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.753
It tells you you declared it,

76
00:03:29.753 --> 00:03:30.883
but you never used it.

77
00:03:30.883 --> 00:03:32.900
So what are you doing?

78
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.710
So, I believe that is here.

79
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.550
Pizza grid.

80
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.130
Pizza grid.

81
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.690
Boom.

82
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.993
That's not what I wanted.

83
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.853
I think let's chalk this up to 500,

84
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.093
not five, four.

85
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.903
There we go.

86
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.180
And then that should, yeah that,

87
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.730
that's responsive by nature.

88
00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.840
Alright, that's looking good.

89
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.940
One more thing is I lied to you.

90
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.700
If we go to this toppings filter

91
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.000
remember where I told you,

92
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.950
we needed to query the toppings here,

93
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.113
and we probably could get away with just using the pizzas?

94
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.870
and then I just did that.

95
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.200
So, you don't actually need to query the toppings here,

96
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.033
the reason being,

97
00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:21.809
is because we're querying all the pizzas

98
00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:23.650
and their toppings,

99
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.360
and we're not actually using the toppings at all here.

100
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.930
So what I'm gonna do is,

101
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.150
I'll leave it like that,

102
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.510
but just so you know,

103
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.870
we're not actually using this in as part of our query.

104
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.890
The actual loop of the toppings comes from,

105
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.260
the aggregation that we did

106
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.020
with that map filter reduce little diddy.

107
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.323
Alright. See, you in the next one.
