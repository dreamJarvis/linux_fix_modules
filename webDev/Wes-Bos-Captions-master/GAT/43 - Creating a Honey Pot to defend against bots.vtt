00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:02.669
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Narrator>Now we're gonna make a honeypot.</v>

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.470
So, one of the unfortunate things about the internet

4
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.560
is that it's not so simple where you just have a form,

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.200
you fill out some fields,

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.330
we create our place order function,

7
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.570
and it sends off an email.

8
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.260
Because there are bad people in the world

9
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.829
and bad people create robots that will destroy us all.

10
00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.380
And what happens with forms that are fill-outable

11
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.130
and submittable without any sort of bot detection,

12
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.070
is that they get submitted with

13
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.920
all kinds of scrupulous stuff from the internet.

14
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.920
So what we need to do is sort of put in some steps

15
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.940
that will at least deter bots

16
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.020
that are just spamming thousands of forms

17
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.180
every single second from submitting that form.

18
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.150
And we actually did a whole,

19
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.670
if you go to syntax.fm, we did a whole podcast on it.

20
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.260
It was called Forms, Captcha.

21
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.093
Here we go.

22
00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:05.550
Hasty Treat - Forms, Captchas, Honeypots,

23
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.770
Dealing With Malicious Users

24
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.190
and the Sad State of Contact Forms.

25
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.170
So listen to that.

26
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.340
If you want to sort of a look into, to all of them.

27
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.510
The best way to do it is to put a Captcha on it,

28
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.170
where you have that little, I am not a robot,

29
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.390
or you have to type in those letters

30
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.500
that don't make any sense,

31
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.040
or fill out forms and things like that.

32
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.459
But I asked on Twitter,

33
00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.210
what do you do if you don't want to put a Captcha in it?

34
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.240
And a lot of people said, just put a honeypot in there.

35
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.670
And that works for almost all of my use cases.

36
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.100
So a honeypot is a field in your contact form

37
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.560
that the user is not supposed to fill out.

38
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.330
And if a bot fills that out,

39
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.530
then you know it's a bot,

40
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.440
because regular people would not have filled that out.

41
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.273
So what we're going to do is

42
00:01:48.273 --> 00:01:52.710
we're going to go over to our order form or our order page.

43
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.603
And we'll look for where we have the email form.

44
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.510
Here we go. And let's just duplicate the label.

45
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.730
Actually, yeah. No, don't even need the label.

46
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.350
Just the input.

47
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.730
And we will change that to, don't call it honey,

48
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.600
because the bots are smart enough not to look for honey.

49
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.840
So being the Canadian I am, we'll call it mapleSyrup,

50
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.433
S-Y-R-U-P.

51
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.560
And then we'll have to go up

52
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.280
to where we created the useForm hook

53
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.023
and also create a mapleSyrup value.

54
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.950
And here we go. So that is our new one.

55
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.680
Then what we'll need to do

56
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.680
is when the person submits the form,

57
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.723
so that is in usePizza,

58
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.533
we will have to add mapleSyrup here,

59
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.010
and that will send the value of this input box

60
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.580
to our server.

61
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.490
And then we'll go to our placeOrder dot (indistinct)

62
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.670
which is our server side.

63
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.220
And we will check if they have submitted

64
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.020
the mapleSyrup field.

65
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.280
So we'll go right here.

66
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.113
Let's go.

67
00:03:14.113 --> 00:03:14.946
First thing we'll check

68
00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:19.170
if they have filled out the honeypot.

69
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.053
So let's say if body.mapleSyrup,

70
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.580
so if it exists,

71
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.080
then we return statusCode 400

72
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.870
and body JSON.stringify - oh, it's capital JSON.

73
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.960
And the message is Boop beep bop zzzzttt good bye.

74
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.140
Okay. That's good.

75
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.670
Another thing I like to do here

76
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.980
is you just put like an error,

77
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.420
like you put like a number in here.

78
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.750
So if somebody, for whatever reason,

79
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.960
somebody fills that out and they're like,

80
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.120
Hey I'm getting an error

81
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.210
three four two three four on your website,

82
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.043
you know exactly,

83
00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.880
oh they hit the honeypot

84
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.670
and there's something wrong with your honeypot.

85
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.780
If a regular user has actually filled that out.

86
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.687
Okay, now let's try to submit it.

87
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.170
So we'll go ahead and fill it out

88
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.190
and we'll fill out our honeypot with just something.

89
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.540
That's what a bot would do.

90
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.940
And then we go ahead and click on Order.

91
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.880
Oh, I forgot to submit it. There we go.

92
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.880
Error. Boop beep bop zzzzttt good bye.

93
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.580
Okay. So that is our honeypot.

94
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.873
Now what we need to do is you need to hide this input.

95
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.250
But we can't just use the hidden attribute on the input

96
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.450
because the bot will be smart enough to figure out

97
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.750
that that is a hidden input

98
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.580
and shouldn't be actually visible.

99
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.580
So what we'll do is we'll go to our styles for our order,

100
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.913
which is orderStyles.

101
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.743
We'll open up that.

102
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.910
And here I'll just say, did we give that one a class?

103
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.960
I think we need to give that one a class.

104
00:05:24.376 --> 00:05:29.376
Let's say, class mapleSyrup, className of mapleSyrup.

105
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.283
I'll go in here.

106
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.170
And we'll just say anything with the class of mapleSyrup

107
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.770
just display none on it.

108
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.660
Now I thought like, okay,

109
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.370
wouldn't a bot be smart enough not to just like,

110
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.240
be able to figure out if it's visible via CSS or not?

111
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.840
And apparently the answer to that is no.

112
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.640
This is coming from dozens of people who use this

113
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.200
in production and client websites.

114
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.280
So that's good enough.

115
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.730
Other ways you could hide it

116
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.100
is you could scale it to zero,

117
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.720
or like scale to one pixel,

118
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.530
or use z-index, or use text indent.

119
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.860
There's all kinds of tricks to hide things on the internet.

120
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.160
But you also have to make sure that you're not throwing off

121
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.751
screen reader users because some CSS attributes

122
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:22.400
will still read themselves aloud to screen reader users.

123
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.730
But if it is display none,

124
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.620
the screen reader will skip over that.

125
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.450
So there's one robot you need to appreciate.

126
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.170
And one robot you need to make sure that they're not there.

127
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.850
Now that is totally missing.

128
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.913
And if let's try to fill it out one more time.

129
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.490
Add a couple pizzas.

130
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.743
Go ahead and submit it.

131
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.230
Boom.

132
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.850
That email has been sent.

133
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.390
So that is a honeypot.

134
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.270
Hopefully enjoy that one.

135
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.770
And catch you in the next one.
