00:00:00.374 --> 00:00:02.957
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.640
there is two more pieces of data that we need to do.

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.790
We need to create the person schema,

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.340
so that we can create people

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.850
and we're gonna learn how to paginate them.

6
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.640
And then we also need, like a settings page.

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.470
And this is a little bit different

8
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.230
because it's going to be for,

9
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.560
like on the homepage.

10
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.130
I wanna be able to specify who is currently slicing pizza.

11
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.670
And then I also wanna specify what pizzas are currently

12
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.360
by the slice or in the case.

13
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.070
And that's not gonna be a multiples.

14
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.530
That's just gonna be store settings.

15
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.860
So we gonna look at how to do that a little later on,

16
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.693
but for right now,

17
00:00:40.693 --> 00:00:44.490
let's create the schema for individual person.

18
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.650
So we'll go into our schema

19
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.040
and create a person dot JS

20
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.090
and let's just go into pizza and copy paste it in.

21
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.313
We'll start at the top.

22
00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:03.390
We wanna grab the M D person icon.

23
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.330
You see why I like to rename this as icon?

24
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.483
Cause I just need to change what the import is

25
00:01:08.483 --> 00:01:10.510
and not have to worry about changing this one right here.

26
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.023
The name is going to be the person.

27
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.350
The title is gonna be sliced masters

28
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.830
and the type is a document icon.

29
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.380
And then we have the name of the person that's just going

30
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.930
to be their name in this case.

31
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.100
We don't need descriptions.

32
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.053
Self-explanatory what it is. There will be a slug.

33
00:01:34.223 --> 00:01:35.770
So we'll just keep that there.

34
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.240
And then we want an image.

35
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.100
So we'll keep that one there as well.

36
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.372
So the image of the person, I like

37
00:01:42.372 --> 00:01:45.686
to do that anytime you're creating multiple data types,

38
00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:48.290
keep the same name, image, slug.

39
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.170
Those are just commonly used names for fields.

40
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.280
So keep them all the same across.

41
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.580
obviously don't need a price

42
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.660
or toppings on a person and then preview.

43
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.570
We don't need any of the preview

44
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.337
because it will just work based on the name

45
00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:06.950
and the image of the person.

46
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.640
So give that a save.

47
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.070
We'll go into our schema that jazz.

48
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.620
I'll duplicate that topping and call it person.

49
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.620
There we go and we'll go down here and inject that.

50
00:02:23.214 --> 00:02:25.800
She came out into our back end.

51
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.360
Now if we go to our back end,

52
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.640
air ratios that we have our slice masters showing up.

53
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.090
Good let's go ahead and add one.

54
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.480
Just make sure it works.

55
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.880
So if you take a look at sample data

56
00:02:38.618 --> 00:02:39.710
and click on text data,

57
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.770
you'll see there's people,

58
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.070
there's a whole bunch of different descriptions

59
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.903
of the people.

60
00:02:44.903 --> 00:02:47.500
I always like to have like some like decent fun data instead

61
00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:50.240
of just typing Loral Epsom.

62
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.530
Lets do slick first

63
00:02:52.364 --> 00:02:55.370
so slick generate the slug

64
00:02:57.755 --> 00:03:00.000
and we forgot the description of the person.

65
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.990
Okay so this is why I love sanity, right?

66
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.560
Like watch, I forgot to put a field

67
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.880
so I can go right into the person

68
00:03:09.738 --> 00:03:13.293
and we'll duplicate slug and I'll name it description.

69
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.240
Type is text and there are no options and this is funny.

70
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.466
We need a description field that says,

71
00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:29.823
tell us a bit about them.

72
00:03:35.008 --> 00:03:38.104
Wash us I'm halfway through creating this data type

73
00:03:38.104 --> 00:03:38.937
and it's still there.

74
00:03:38.937 --> 00:03:39.960
My data is still there.

75
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.880
I can paste in my description of the person

76
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.350
and then let's upload an image going to slice masters.

77
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.193
Here's slick and it's loaded in publish.

78
00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:58.912
And now you see it's like a showing up

79
00:03:58.912 --> 00:03:59.745
in the sidebar here again.

80
00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:02.290
It's taking the name and image field,

81
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.123
so we don't have

82
00:04:03.123 --> 00:04:05.880
to do a custom preview there that's good enough for me.

83
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.180
Alright, that's the last data input in the next video?

84
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.360
What we'll do is we'll look

85
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.540
at how human create custom react components

86
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.890
for input specifically for the pizza price

87
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.483
and I'll see in that one.
