Edit Distance Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings are, i.e., how many operations (add, delete or replace character) it would take to transform one string to the other. This is one of the most common variants of edit distance, also called Levenshtein distance, named after Soviet computer scientist, Vladimir Levenshtein. There are 3 operations which can be applied to either string, namely: insertion, deletion and replacement.
