if you have installed pop theme as the default theme then follow these steps to fix the system settings :

remove pop-theme :
    sudo ppa-purge ppa:system76/pop &&

remove system76/pop repository and GPG key from /etc/apt/* :
    First you need to find the key id of the key you added. Do this by the command:

    sudo apt-key list
    It will list all the keys that you have, with each entry looking like this:

    pub   1024R/B455BEF0 2010-07-29
    uid                  Launchpad clicompanion-nightlies
    Once you have figured out which key to remove, use the command sudo apt-key del <keyid> where <keyid> is replaced with the actual keyid of the key you want to remove from your keyring.

    $ sudo apt-key del B455BEF0
    $ apt-key list | grep clicompan

remove apt cache :
    sudo apt-get clean

remove broken gnome-control-center from system76/pop :
    sudo apt-get remove gnome-control-center
    sudo apt autoremove

install original gnome-control-center :
    sudo apt-get install gnome-control-center
